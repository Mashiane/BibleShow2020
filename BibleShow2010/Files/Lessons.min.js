Darkness was on the surface of the deep. God's Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters.\r {BR}3  God said, Let there be light, and there was light.\r {BR}4  God saw the light, and saw that it was good. God divided the light from the darkness.\r {BR}5  God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. There was evening and there was morning, one day.\r {BR}6  God said, Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.\r {BR}7  God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so.\r {BR}8  God called the expanse sky. There was evening and there was morning, a second day.\r {BR}9  God said, Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear; and it was so.\r {BR}10  God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters he called Seas. God saw that it was good.\r {BR}11  God said, Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with its seed in it, on the earth; and it was so.\r {BR}12  The earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with its seed in it, after their kind; and God saw that it was good.\r {BR}13  There was evening and there was morning, a third day.\r {BR}14  God said, Let there be lights in the expanse of sky to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years;\r {BR}15  and let them be for lights in the expanse of sky to give light on the earth; and it was so.\r {BR}16  God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He also made the stars.\r {BR}17  God set them in the expanse of sky to give light to the earth,\r {BR}18  and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. God saw that it was good.\r {BR}19  There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.\r {BR}20  God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of sky.\r {BR}21  God created the large sea creatures, and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind.

God saw that it was good.\r {BR}26  God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky, and over the livestock, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.\r {BR}27  God created man in his own image.

It will be your food.\r {BR}30  To every animal of the earth, and to every bird of the sky, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food; and it was so.\r {BR}31  God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good.

There was not a man to till the ground,\r {BR}6  but a mist went up from the earth, and watered the whole surface of the ground.\r {BR}7  Yahweh God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.\r {BR}8  Yahweh God planted a garden eastward, in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had formed.\r {BR}9  Out of the ground Yahweh God made every tree to grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the middle of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.\r {BR}10  A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was parted, and became four heads.\r {BR}11  The name of the first is Pishon: this is the one which flows through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;\r {BR}12  and the gold of that land is good. There is aromatic resin and the onyx stone.\r {BR}13  The name of the second river is Gihon: the same river that flows through the whole land of Cush.\r {BR}14  The name of the third river is Hiddekel: this is the one which flows in front of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates.\r {BR}15  Yahweh God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.\r {BR}16  Yahweh God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat;\r {BR}17  but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat of it; for in the day that you eat of it you will surely die.\r {BR}18  Yahweh God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper suitable for him.\r {BR}19  Out of the ground Yahweh God formed every animal of the field, and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. Whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.\r {BR}20  The man gave names to all livestock, and to the birds of the sky, and to every animal of the field; but for man there was not found a helper suitable for him.\r {BR}21  Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall on the man, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place.\r {BR}22  He made the rib, which Yahweh God had taken from the man, into a woman, and brought her to the man.\r {BR}23  The man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She will be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.\r {BR}24  Therefore a man will leave his father and his mother, and will join with his wife, and they will be one flesh.\r {BR}25  They were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.\r {BR}{BR}{I}{B}WEB\\Genesis\\3:1-24{/I}{/B}{BR}{BR}1  Now the serpent was more subtle than any animal of the field which Yahweh God had made.

They sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.\r {BR}8  They heard the voice of Yahweh God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden.\r {BR}9  Yahweh God called to the man, and said to him, Where are you?\r {BR}10  The man said, I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.\r {BR}11  God said, Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?\r {BR}12  The man said, The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.\r {BR}13  Yahweh God said to the woman, What is this you have done? The woman said, The serpent deceived me, and I ate.\r {BR}14  Yahweh God said to the serpent, Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock, and above every animal of the field. On your belly you shall go, and you shall eat dust all the days of your life.\r {BR}15  I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring. He will bruise your head, and you will bruise his heel.\r {BR}16  To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth. In pain you will bring forth children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you.\r {BR}17  To Adam he said, Because you have listened to your wife's voice, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, 'You shall not eat of it,' cursed is the ground for your sake. In toil you will eat of it all the days of your life.\r {BR}18  Thorns also and thistles will it bring forth to you; and you will eat the herb of the field.\r {BR}19  By the sweat of your face will you eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For you are dust, and to dust you shall return.\r {BR}20  The man called his wife Eve, because she was the mother of all living.\r {BR}21  Yahweh God made coats of skins for Adam and for his wife, and clothed them.\r {BR}22  Yahweh God said, Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. Now, lest he put forth his hand, and also take of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever...\r {BR}23  Therefore Yahweh God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.\r {BR}24  So he drove out the man; and he placed Cherubs at the east of the garden of Eden, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.\r {BR}{BR}"},{lessontitle:"The First Murder",lessonscriptures:"Genesis\\4:1-16",id:"2",verses:"{I}{B}WEB\\Genesis\\4:1-16{/I}{/B}{BR}{BR}1  The man knew Eve his wife.

Yahweh respected Abel and his offering,\r {BR}5  but he didn't respect Cain and his offering. Cain was very angry, and the expression on his face fell.\r {BR}6  Yahweh said to Cain, Why are you angry? Why has the expression of your face fallen?\r {BR}7  If you do well, will it not be lifted up? If you don't do well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire is for you, but you are to rule over it.\r {BR}8  Cain said to Abel, his brother, Let's go into the field. It happened when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and killed him.\r {BR}9  Yahweh said to Cain, Where is Abel, your brother? He said, I don't know. Am I my brother's keeper?\r {BR}10  Yahweh said, What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood cries to me from the ground.\r {BR}11  Now you are cursed because of the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.\r {BR}12  From now on, when you till the ground, it won't yield its strength to you. You shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth.\r {BR}13  Cain said to Yahweh, My punishment is greater than I can bear.\r {BR}14  Behold, you have driven me out this day from the surface of the ground. I will be hidden from your face, and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. It will happen that whoever finds me will kill me.\r {BR}15  Yahweh said to him, Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold.

They bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown.\r {BR}5  Yahweh saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.\r {BR}6  Yahweh was sorry that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him in his heart.\r {BR}7  Yahweh said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the surface of the ground; man, along with animals, creeping things, and birds of the sky; for I am sorry that I have made them.\r {BR}8  But Noah found favor in Yahweh's eyes.\r {BR}9  This is the history of the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time. Noah walked with God.\r {BR}10  Noah became the father of three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\r {BR}11  The earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.\r {BR}12  God saw the earth, and saw that it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth.\r {BR}13  God said to Noah, The end of all flesh has come before me, for the earth is filled with violence through them.

The waters increased, and lifted up the ship, and it was lifted up above the earth.\r {BR}18  The waters prevailed, and increased greatly on the earth; and the ship floated on the surface of the waters.\r {BR}19  The waters prevailed exceedingly on the earth. All the high mountains that were under the whole sky were covered.\r {BR}20  The waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward, and the mountains were covered.\r {BR}21  All flesh died that moved on the earth, including birds, livestock, animals, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and every man.\r {BR}22  All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was on the dry land, died.\r {BR}23  Every living thing was destroyed that was on the surface of the ground, including man, livestock, creeping things, and birds of the sky.

After the end of one hundred fifty days the waters decreased.\r {BR}4  The ship rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on Ararat's mountains.\r {BR}5  The waters receded continually until the tenth month.

Noah removed the covering of the ship, and looked. He saw that the surface of the ground was dried.\r {BR}14  In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.\r {BR}15  God spoke to Noah, saying,\r {BR}16  Go out of the ship, you, and your wife, and your sons, and your sons' wives with you.\r {BR}17  Bring forth with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh, including birds, livestock, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply on the earth.\r {BR}18  Noah went forth, with his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives with him.\r {BR}19  Every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatever moves on the earth, after their families, went out of the ship.\r {BR}20  Noah built an altar to Yahweh, and took of every clean animal, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.\r {BR}21  Yahweh smelled the pleasant aroma. Yahweh said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake, because the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I ever again strike everything living, as I have done.\r {BR}22  While the earth remains, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.\r {BR}{BR}{I}{B}WEB\\Genesis\\9:1-29{/I}{/B}{BR}{BR}1  God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.\r {BR}2  The fear of you and the dread of you will be on every animal of the earth, and on every bird of the sky.

On the seventh day, you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.\r {BR}5  It shall be that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man straight before him.\r {BR}6  Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of Yahweh.\r {BR}7  They said to the people, Advance! March around the city, and let the armed men pass on before Yahweh's ark.\r {BR}8  It was so, that when Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before Yahweh advanced, and blew the trumpets; and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh followed them.\r {BR}9  The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the ark went after them. The trumpets sounded as they went.\r {BR}10  Joshua commanded the people, saying, You shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I tell you to shout. Then you shall shout.\r {BR}11  So he caused the ark of Yahweh to go around the city, going about it once. Then they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.\r {BR}12  Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of Yahweh.\r {BR}13  The seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of Yahweh went on continually, and blew the trumpets: and the armed men went before them. The rear guard came after the ark of Yahweh. The trumpets sounded as they went.\r {BR}14  The second day they marched around the city once, and returned into the camp. They did this six days.\r {BR}15  It happened on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and marched around the city in the same way seven times. Only on this day they marched around the city seven times.\r {BR}16  It happened at the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, Shout, for Yahweh has given you the city!\r {BR}17  The city shall be devoted, even it and all that is in it, to Yahweh. Only Rahab the prostitute shall live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.\r {BR}18  But as for you, only keep yourselves from the devoted thing, lest when you have devoted it, you take of the devoted thing; so would you make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it.\r {BR}19  But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are holy to Yahweh. They shall come into Yahweh's treasury.\r {BR}20  So the people shouted, and the priests blew the trumpets. It happened, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.\r {BR}21  They utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and donkey, with the edge of the sword.\r {BR}22  Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, Go into the prostitute's house, and bring out from there the woman and all that she has, as you swore to her.\r {BR}23  The young men who were spies went in, and brought out Rahab with her father, her mother, her brothers, and all that she had. They also brought out all her relatives, and they set them outside of the camp of Israel.\r {BR}24  They burnt the city with fire, and all that was in it. Only they put the silver, the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron into the treasury of Yahweh's house.\r {BR}25  But Rahab the prostitute, her father's household, and all that she had, Joshua saved alive. She lived in the midst of Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers, whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.\r {BR}26  Joshua commanded them with an oath at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before Yahweh, who rises up and builds this city Jericho. With the loss of his firstborn shall he lay its foundation, and with the loss of his youngest son shall he set up its gates.\r {BR}27  So Yahweh was with Joshua; and his fame was in all the land.\r {BR}{BR}"},{lessontitle:"Gideon",lessonscriptures:"Judges\\6:1-40;Judges\\7:1-25;Judges\\8:1-35",id:"18",verses:"{I}{B}WEB\\Judges\\6:1-40{/I}{/B}{BR}{BR}1  The children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh: and Yahweh delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.\r {BR}2  The hand of Midian prevailed against Israel; and because of Midian the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds.\r {BR}3  So it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east; they came up against them;\r {BR}4  and they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, until you come to Gaza, and left no sustenance in Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor donkey.\r {BR}5  For they came up with their livestock and their tents; they came in as locusts for multitude; both they and their camels were without number: and they came into the land to destroy it.\r {BR}6  Israel was brought very low because of Midian; and the children of Israel cried to Yahweh.\r {BR}7  It happened, when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh because of Midian,\r {BR}8  that Yahweh sent a prophet to the children of Israel: and he said to them, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;\r {BR}9  and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land;\r {BR}10  and I said to you, I am Yahweh your God; you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell.

So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and took the waters as far as Beth Barah, even the Jordan.\r {BR}25  They took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian: and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.\r {BR}{BR}{I}{B}WEB\\Judges\\8:1-35{/I}{/B}{BR}{BR}1  The men of Ephraim said to him, Why have you treated us this way, that you didn't call us, when you went to fight with Midian?

Each one resembled the children of a king.\r {BR}19  He said, They were my brothers, the sons of my mother: as Yahweh lives, if you had saved them alive, I would not kill you.\r {BR}20  He said to Jether his firstborn, Up, and kill them. But the youth didn't draw his sword; for he feared, because he was yet a youth.\r {BR}21  Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise and fall on us; for as the man is, so is his strength.

Please take her, instead.\r {BR}3  Samson said to them, This time shall I be blameless in regard of the Philistines, when I do them a mischief.\r {BR}4  Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between every two tails.\r {BR}5  When he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks and the standing grain, and also the olive groves.\r {BR}6  Then the Philistines said, Who has done this?

The Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.\r {BR}7  Samson said to them, If you behave like this, surely I will be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.\r {BR}8  He struck them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and lived in the cleft of the rock of Etam.\r {BR}9  Then the Philistines went up, and encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.\r {BR}10  The men of Judah said, Why have you come up against us? They said, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he has done to us.\r {BR}11  Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, Don't you know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is this that you have done to us?

They bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock.\r {BR}14  When he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him: and the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on him, and the ropes that were on his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands dropped from off his hands.\r {BR}15  He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, and put forth his hand, and took it, and struck a thousand men therewith.\r {BR}16  Samson said, With the jawbone of a donkey, heaps on heaps, With the jawbone of a donkey I have struck a thousand men.\r {BR}17  It happened, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand; and that place was called Ramath Lehi.\r {BR}18  He was very thirsty, and called on Yahweh, and said, You have given this great deliverance by the hand of your servant; and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised.\r {BR}19  But God split the hollow place that is in Lehi, and water came out of it.

Now therefore go up; for at this time you shall find him.\r {BR}14  They went up to the city; ({I}{B}and{/B}{/I}) as they came within the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place.\r {BR}15  Now Yahweh had revealed to Samuel a day before Saul came, saying,\r {BR}16  Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man out of the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be prince over my people Israel; and he shall save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked on my people, because their cry is come to me.\r {BR}17  When Samuel saw Saul, Yahweh said to him, Behold, the man of whom I spoke to you! this same shall have authority over my people.\r {BR}18  Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, Please, where the seer's house is.\r {BR}19  Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer; go up before me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today: and in the morning I will let you go, and will tell you all that is in your heart.\r {BR}20  As for your donkeys who were lost three days ago, don't set your mind on them; for they are found. For whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for you, and for all your father's house?\r {BR}21  Saul answered, Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? why then speak you to me after this manner?\r {BR}22  Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the guest room, and made them sit in the best place among those who were invited, who were about thirty persons.\r {BR}23  Samuel said to the cook, Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said to you, Set it aside.\r {BR}24  The cook took up the thigh, and that which was on it, and set it before Saul. ({I}{B}Samuel{/B}{/I}) said, Behold, that which has been reserved! set it before yourself and eat; because to the appointed time has it been kept for you, for I said, I have invited the people. So Saul ate with Samuel that day.\r {BR}25  When they had come down from the high place into the city, he talked with Saul on the housetop.\r {BR}26  They arose early: and it happened about the spring of the day, that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying, Up, that I may send you away. Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.\r {BR}27  As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us  (and he passed on), but stand still first, that I may cause you to hear the word of God.\r {BR}{BR}{I}{B}WEB\\1 Samuel\\10:1-27{/I}{/B}{BR}{BR}1  Then Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him, and said, Isn't it that Yahweh has anointed you to be prince over his inheritance?\r {BR}2  When you have departed from me today, then you shall find two men by Rachel's tomb, in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will tell you, The donkeys which you went to seek have been found; and behold, your father has stopped caring about the donkeys, and is anxious for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?\r {BR}3  Then you shall go on forward from there, and you shall come to the oak of Tabor; and three men shall meet you there going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:\r {BR}4  and they will greet you, and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall receive of their hand.\r {BR}5  After that you shall come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall happen, when you have come there to the city, that you shall meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tambourine, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they will be prophesying:\r {BR}6  and the Spirit of Yahweh will come mightily on you, and you shall prophesy with them, and shall be turned into another man.\r {BR}7  Let it be, when these signs have come to you, that you do as occasion shall serve you; for God is with you.\r {BR}8  You shall go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to you, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: you shall wait seven days, until I come to you, and show you what you shall do.\r {BR}9  It was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs happened that day.\r {BR}10  When they came there to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came mightily on him, and he prophesied among them.\r {BR}11  It happened, when all who knew him before saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?\r {BR}12  One of the same place answered, Who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?\r {BR}13  When he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.\r {BR}14  Saul's uncle said to him and to his servant, Where did you go? He said, To seek the donkeys; and when we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel.\r {BR}15  Saul's uncle said, Tell me, Please, what Samuel said to you.\r {BR}16  Saul said to his uncle, He told us plainly that the donkeys were found. But concerning the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel spoke, he didn't tell him.\r {BR}17  Samuel called the people together to Yahweh to Mizpah;\r {BR}18  and he said to the children of Israel, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you:\r {BR}19  but you have this day rejected your God, who himself saves you out of all your calamities and your distresses; and you have said to him, ({I}{B}No{/B}{/I}), but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before Yahweh by your tribes, and by your thousands.\r {BR}20  So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken.\r {BR}21  He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families; and the family of the Matrites was taken; and Saul the son of Kish was taken: but when they sought him, he could not be found.\r {BR}22  Therefore they asked of Yahweh further, Is there yet a man to come here? Yahweh answered, Behold, he has hid himself among the baggage.\r {BR}23  They ran and fetched him there; and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.\r {BR}24  Samuel said to all the people, You see him whom Yahweh has chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? All the people shouted, and said, ({I}{B}Long{/B}{/I}) live the king.\r {BR}25  Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before Yahweh. Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.\r {BR}26  Saul also went to his house to Gibeah; and there went with him the army, whose hearts God had touched.\r {BR}27  But certain worthless fellows said, How shall this man save us?

The king said to her, Ask on, my mother; for I will not deny you.\r {BR}21  She said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as wife.\r {BR}22  King Solomon answered his mother, Why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is my elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.\r {BR}23  Then king Solomon swore by Yahweh, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life.\r {BR}24  Now therefore as Yahweh lives, who has established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me a house, as he promised, surely Adonijah shall be put to death this day.\r {BR}25  King Solomon sent by Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell on him, so that he died.\r {BR}26  To Abiathar the priest said the king, Go to Anathoth, to your own fields; for you are worthy of death: but I will not at this time put you to death, because you bore the ark of the Lord Yahweh before David my father, and because you were afflicted in all in which my father was afflicted.\r {BR}27  So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to Yahweh, that he might fulfill the word of Yahweh, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.\r {BR}28  The news came to Joab; for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he didn't turn after Absalom. Joab fled to the Tent of Yahweh, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.\r {BR}29  It was told king Solomon, Joab is fled to the Tent of Yahweh, and behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall on him.\r {BR}30  Benaiah came to the Tent of Yahweh, and said to him, Thus says the king, Come forth. He said, No; but I will die here. Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.\r {BR}31  The king said to him, Do as he has said, and fall on him, and bury him; that you may take away the blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and from my father's house.\r {BR}32  Yahweh will return his blood on his own head, because he fell on two men more righteous and better than he, and killed them with the sword, and my father David didn't know it, ({I}{B}to wit{/B}{/I}), Abner the son of Ner, captain of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the army of Judah.\r {BR}33  So shall their blood return on the head of Joab, and on the head of his seed forever: but to David, and to his seed, and to his house, and to his throne, shall there be peace for ever from Yahweh.\r {BR}34  Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell on him, and killed him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.\r {BR}35  The king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the army; and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.\r {BR}36  The king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Build yourself a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and don't go forth from there any where.\r {BR}37  For on the day you go out, and pass over the brook Kidron, know for certain that you shall surely die: your blood shall be on your own head.\r {BR}38  Shimei said to the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king has said, so will your servant do.
