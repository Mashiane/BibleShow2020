Darkness was on the surface of the deep. God's Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters.\r {BR}3  God said, Let there be light, and there was light.\r {BR}4  God saw the light, and saw that it was good. God divided the light from the darkness.\r {BR}5  God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. There was evening and there was morning, one day.\r {BR}6  God said, Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.\r {BR}7  God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so.\r {BR}8  God called the expanse sky. There was evening and there was morning, a second day.\r {BR}9  God said, Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear; and it was so.\r {BR}10  God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters he called Seas. God saw that it was good.\r {BR}11  God said, Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with its seed in it, on the earth; and it was so.\r {BR}12  The earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with its seed in it, after their kind; and God saw that it was good.\r {BR}13  There was evening and there was morning, a third day.\r {BR}14  God said, Let there be lights in the expanse of sky to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years;\r {BR}15  and let them be for lights in the expanse of sky to give light on the earth; and it was so.\r {BR}16  God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He also made the stars.\r {BR}17  God set them in the expanse of sky to give light to the earth,\r {BR}18  and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. God saw that it was good.\r {BR}19  There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.\r {BR}20  God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of sky.\r {BR}21  God created the large sea creatures, and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind. God saw that it was good.\r {BR}22  God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.\r {BR}23  There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.\r {BR}24  God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, livestock, creeping things, and animals of the earth after their kind; and it was so.\r {BR}25  God made the animals of the earth after their kind, and the livestock after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind. God saw that it was good.\r {BR}26  God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky, and over the livestock, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.\r {BR}27  God created man in his own image. In God's image he created him; male and female he created them.\r {BR}28  God blessed them. God said to them, Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the sky, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.\r {BR}29  God said, Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree, which bears fruit yielding seed. It will be your food.\r {BR}30  To every animal of the earth, and to every bird of the sky, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food; and it was so.\r {BR}31  God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good.

You shall take it from the sheep, or from the goats:\r {BR}6  and you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month; and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at evening.\r {BR}7  They shall take some of the blood, and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel, on the houses in which they shall eat it.\r {BR}8  They shall eat the flesh in that night, roasted with fire, and unleavened bread.

The people bowed their heads and worshiped.\r {BR}28  The children of Israel went and did so; as Yahweh had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.\r {BR}29  It happened at midnight, that Yahweh struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of livestock.\r {BR}30  Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not one dead.\r {BR}31  He called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, get out from among my people, both you and the children of Israel; and go, serve Yahweh, as you have said!\r {BR}32  Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone; and bless me also!\r {BR}33  The Egyptians were urgent with the people, to send them out of the land in haste, for they said, We are all dead men.\r {BR}34  The people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes on their shoulders.\r {BR}35  The children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing.\r {BR}36  Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. They despoiled the Egyptians.\r {BR}37  The children of Israel traveled from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot who were men, besides children.\r {BR}38  A mixed multitude went up also with them, with flocks, herds, and even very much livestock.\r {BR}39  They baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt; for it wasn't leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, and couldn't wait, neither had they prepared for themselves any food.\r {BR}40  Now the time that the children of Israel lived in Egypt was four hundred thirty years.\r {BR}41  It happened at the end of four hundred thirty years, even the same day it happened, that all the armies of Yahweh went out from the land of Egypt.\r {BR}42  It is a night to be much observed to Yahweh for bringing them out from the land of Egypt. This is that night of Yahweh, to be much observed of all the children of Israel throughout their generations.\r {BR}43  Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the Passover. There shall no foreigner eat of it,\r {BR}44  but every man's servant who is bought for money, when you have circumcised him, then shall he eat of it.\r {BR}45  A foreigner and a hired servant shall not eat of it.\r {BR}46  In one house shall it be eaten; you shall not carry forth anything of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall you break a bone of it.\r {BR}47  All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.\r {BR}48  When a stranger shall live as a foreigner with you, and will keep the Passover to Yahweh, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one who is born in the land: but no uncircumcised person shall eat of it.\r {BR}49  One law shall be to him who is born at home, and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner among you.\r {BR}50  All the children of Israel did so.
