Darkness was on the surface of the deep.

God divided the light from the darkness.\r {BR}5  God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. There was evening and there was morning, one day.\r {BR}6  God said, Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.\r {BR}7  God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so.\r {BR}8  God called the expanse sky. There was evening and there was morning, a second day.\r {BR}9  God said, Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear; and it was so.\r {BR}10  God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters he called Seas.

He also made the stars.\r {BR}17  God set them in the expanse of sky to give light to the earth,\r {BR}18  and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness.

It will be your food.\r {BR}30  To every animal of the earth, and to every bird of the sky, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food; and it was so.\r {BR}31  God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good.

The waters increased, and lifted up the ship, and it was lifted up above the earth.\r {BR}18  The waters prevailed, and increased greatly on the earth; and the ship floated on the surface of the waters.\r {BR}19  The waters prevailed exceedingly on the earth. All the high mountains that were under the whole sky were covered.\r {BR}20  The waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward, and the mountains were covered.\r {BR}21  All flesh died that moved on the earth, including birds, livestock, animals, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and every man.\r {BR}22  All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was on the dry land, died.\r {BR}23  Every living thing was destroyed that was on the surface of the ground, including man, livestock, creeping things, and birds of the sky.

After the end of one hundred fifty days the waters decreased.\r {BR}4  The ship rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on Ararat's mountains.\r {BR}5  The waters receded continually until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.\r {BR}6  It happened at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ship which he had made,\r {BR}7  and he sent forth a raven.

Noah removed the covering of the ship, and looked. He saw that the surface of the ground was dried.\r {BR}14  In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.\r {BR}15  God spoke to Noah, saying,\r {BR}16  Go out of the ship, you, and your wife, and your sons, and your sons' wives with you.\r {BR}17  Bring forth with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh, including birds, livestock, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply on the earth.\r {BR}18  Noah went forth, with his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives with him.\r {BR}19  Every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatever moves on the earth, after their families, went out of the ship.\r {BR}20  Noah built an altar to Yahweh, and took of every clean animal, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.\r {BR}21  Yahweh smelled the pleasant aroma. Yahweh said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake, because the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I ever again strike everything living, as I have done.\r {BR}22  While the earth remains, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.\r {BR}{BR}{I}{B}WEB\\Genesis\\9{/I}{/B}{BR}{BR}1  God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.\r {BR}2  The fear of you and the dread of you will be on every animal of the earth, and on every bird of the sky.

It had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.\r {BR}12  Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I have grown old will I have pleasure, my lord being old also?\r {BR}13  Yahweh said to Abraham, Why did Sarah laugh, saying, 'Will I really bear a child, yet I am old?'\r {BR}14  Is anything too hard for Yahweh? At the set time I will return to you, when the season comes round, and Sarah will have a son.\r {BR}15  Then Sarah denied, saying, I didn't laugh, for she was afraid. He said, No, but you did laugh.\r {BR}16  The men rose up from there, and looked toward Sodom. Abraham went with them to see them on their way.\r {BR}17  Yahweh said, Will I hide from Abraham what I do,\r {BR}18  seeing that Abraham has surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him?\r {BR}19  For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of Yahweh, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that Yahweh may bring on Abraham that which he has spoken of him.\r {BR}20  Yahweh said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous,\r {BR}21  I will go down now, and see whether their deeds are as bad as the reports which have come to me. If not, I will know.\r {BR}22  The men turned from there, and went toward Sodom, but Abraham stood yet before Yahweh.\r {BR}23  Abraham drew near, and said, Will you consume the righteous with the wicked?\r {BR}24  What if there are fifty righteous within the city? Will you consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous who are in it?\r {BR}25  Be it far from you to do things like that, to kill the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be like the wicked. May that be far from you. Shouldn't the Judge of all the earth do right?\r {BR}26  Yahweh said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sake.\r {BR}27  Abraham answered, See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord, who am but dust and ashes.\r {BR}28  What if there will lack five of the fifty righteous? Will you destroy all the city for lack of five? He said, I will not destroy it, if I find forty-five there.\r {BR}29  He spoke to him yet again, and said, What if there are forty found there? He said, I will not do it for the forty's sake.\r {BR}30  He said, Oh don't let the Lord be angry, and I will speak. What if there are thirty found there? He said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.\r {BR}31  He said, See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord. What if there are twenty found there? He said, I will not destroy it for the twenty's sake.\r {BR}32  He said, Oh don't let the Lord be angry, and I will speak just once more. What if ten are found there? He said, I will not destroy it for the ten's sake.\r {BR}33  Yahweh went his way, as soon as he had finished communing with Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.\r {BR}{BR}{I}{B}WEB\\Genesis\\19{/I}{/B}{BR}{BR}1  The two angels came to Sodom at evening. Lot sat in the gate of Sodom. Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them. He bowed himself with his face to the earth,\r {BR}2  and he said, See now, my lords, please turn aside into your servant's house, stay all night, wash your feet, and you will rise up early, and go on your way. They said, No, but we will stay in the street all night.\r {BR}3  He urged them greatly, and they came in with him, and entered into his house. He made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.\r {BR}4  But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter.\r {BR}5  They called to Lot, and said to him, Where are the men who came in to you this night? Bring them out to us, that we may have sex with them.\r {BR}6  Lot went out to them to the door, and shut the door after him.\r {BR}7  He said, Please, my brothers, don't act so wickedly.\r {BR}8  See now, I have two virgin daughters. Please let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them what seems good to you. Only don't do anything to these men, because they have come under the shadow of my roof.\r {BR}9  They said, Stand back! Then they said, This one fellow came in to live as a foreigner, and he appoints himself a judge. Now will we deal worse with you, than with them! They pressed hard on the man Lot, and drew near to break the door.\r {BR}10  But the men put forth their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut the door.\r {BR}11  They struck the men who were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door.\r {BR}12  The men said to Lot, Do you have anybody else here? Sons-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whoever you have in the city, bring them out of the place:\r {BR}13  for we will destroy this place, because the outcry against them has grown great before Yahweh that Yahweh has sent us to destroy it.\r {BR}14  Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters, and said, Get up! Get out of this place, for Yahweh will destroy the city. But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be joking.\r {BR}15  When the morning came, then the angels hurried Lot, saying, Get up! Take your wife, and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city.\r {BR}16  But he lingered; and the men grabbed his hand, his wife's hand, and his two daughters' hands, Yahweh being merciful to him; and they took him out, and set him outside of the city.\r {BR}17  It came to pass, when they had taken them out, that he said, Escape for your life! Don't look behind you, and don't stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the mountains, lest you be consumed!\r {BR}18  Lot said to them, Oh, not so, my lord.\r {BR}19  See now, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have magnified your loving kindness, which you have shown to me in saving my life. I can't escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die.\r {BR}20  See now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one. Oh let me escape there  (isn't it a little one?), and my soul will live.\r {BR}21  He said to him, Behold, I have granted your request concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken.\r {BR}22  Hurry, escape there, for I can't do anything until you get there. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.\r {BR}23  The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar.\r {BR}24  Then Yahweh rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah sulfur and fire from Yahweh out of the sky.\r {BR}25  He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground.\r {BR}26  But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.\r {BR}27  Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before Yahweh.\r {BR}28  He looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and looked, and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.\r {BR}29  It happened, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the middle of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot lived.\r {BR}30  Lot went up out of Zoar, and lived in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he was afraid to live in Zoar. He lived in a cave with his two daughters.\r {BR}31  The firstborn said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth.\r {BR}32  Come, let's make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve our father's seed.\r {BR}33  They made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father. He didn't know when she lay down, nor when she arose.\r {BR}34  It came to pass on the next day, that the firstborn said to the younger, Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let us make him drink wine again, tonight. You go in, and lie with him, that we may preserve our father's seed.\r {BR}35  They made their father drink wine that night also. The younger went and lay with him. He didn't know when she lay down, nor when she got up.\r {BR}36  Thus both of Lot's daughters were with child by their father.\r {BR}37  The firstborn bore a son, and named him Moab. He is the father of the Moabites to this day.\r {BR}38  The younger also bore a son, and called his name Ben Ammi.

They both went together.\r {BR}7  Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, My father? He said, Here I am, my son. He said, Here is the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?\r {BR}8  Abraham said, God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son. So they both went together.\r {BR}9  They came to the place which God had told him of.

For now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.\r {BR}13  Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son.\r {BR}14  Abraham called the name of that place Yahweh Will Provide. As it is said to this day, On Yahweh's mountain, it will be provided.\r {BR}15  The angel of Yahweh called to Abraham a second time out of the sky,\r {BR}16  and said, I have sworn by myself, says Yahweh, because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son,\r {BR}17  that I will bless you greatly, and I will multiply your seed greatly like the stars of the heavens, and like the sand which is on the seashore.

For out of that well they watered the flocks. The stone on the well's mouth was large.\r {BR}3  There all the flocks were gathered. They rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again on the well's mouth in its place.\r {BR}4  Jacob said to them, My relatives, where are you from? They said, We are from Haran.\r {BR}5  He said to them, Do you know Laban, the son of Nahor? They said, We know him.\r {BR}6  He said to them, Is it well with him? They said, It is well. See, Rachel, his daughter, is coming with the sheep.\r {BR}7  He said, Behold, it is still the middle of the day, not time to gather the livestock together. Water the sheep, and go and feed them.\r {BR}8  They said, We can't, until all the flocks are gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well's mouth. Then we water the sheep.\r {BR}9  While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she kept them.\r {BR}10  It happened, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban, his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.\r {BR}11  Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.\r {BR}12  Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son. She ran and told her father.\r {BR}13  It happened, when Laban heard the news of Jacob, his sister's son, that he ran to meet Jacob, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things.\r {BR}14  Laban said to him, Surely you are my bone and my flesh. He lived with him for a month.\r {BR}15  Laban said to Jacob, Because you are my brother, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what will your wages be?\r {BR}16  Laban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.\r {BR}17  Leah's eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and attractive.\r {BR}18  Jacob loved Rachel. He said, I will serve you seven years for Rachel, your younger daughter.\r {BR}19  Laban said, It is better that I give her to you, than that I should give her to another man. Stay with me.\r {BR}20  Jacob served seven years for Rachel. They seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had for her.\r {BR}21  Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.\r {BR}22  Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.\r {BR}23  It happened in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him. He went in to her.\r {BR}24  Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid to his daughter Leah for a handmaid.\r {BR}25  It happened in the morning that, behold, it was Leah. He said to Laban, What is this you have done to me? Didn't I serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?\r {BR}26  Laban said, It is not done so in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn.\r {BR}27  Fulfill the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you will serve with me yet seven other years.\r {BR}28  Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. He gave him Rachel his daughter as wife.\r {BR}29  Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah, his handmaid, to be her handmaid.\r {BR}30  He went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.\r {BR}31  Yahweh saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.\r {BR}32  Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she named him Reuben. For she said, Because Yahweh has looked at my affliction.

She named him Simeon.\r {BR}34  She conceived again, and bore a son. Said, Now this time will my husband be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons. Therefore was his name called Levi.\r {BR}35  She conceived again, and bore a son. She said, This time will I praise Yahweh. Therefore she named him Judah. Then she stopped bearing.\r {BR}{BR}{I}{B}WEB\\Genesis\\30{/I}{/B}{BR}{BR}1  When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister. She said to Jacob, Give me children, or else I will die.\r {BR}2  Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel, and he said, Am I in God's place, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?\r {BR}3  She said, Behold, my maid Bilhah. Go in to her, that she may bear on my knees, and I also may obtain children by her.\r {BR}4  She gave him Bilhah her handmaid as wife, and Jacob went in to her.\r {BR}5  Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son.\r {BR}6  Rachel said, God has judged me, and has also heard my voice, and has given me a son. Therefore called she his name Dan.\r {BR}7  Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid, conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son.\r {BR}8  Rachel said, With mighty wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and have prevailed. She named him Naphtali.\r {BR}9  When Leah saw that she had finished bearing, she took Zilpah, her handmaid, and gave her to Jacob as a wife.\r {BR}10  Zilpah, Leah's handmaid, bore Jacob a son.\r {BR}11  Leah said, How fortunate!

Then Rachel said to Leah, Please give me some of your son's mandrakes.\r {BR}15  She said to her, Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son's mandrakes, also? Rachel said, Therefore he will lie with you tonight for your son's mandrakes.\r {BR}16  Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, You must come in to me; for I have surely hired you with my son's mandrakes. He lay with her that night.\r {BR}17  God listened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob a fifth son.\r {BR}18  Leah said, God has given me my hire, because I gave my handmaid to my husband. She named him Issachar.\r {BR}19  Leah conceived again, and bore a sixth son to Jacob.\r {BR}20  Leah said, God has endowed me with a good dowry. Now my husband will live with me, because I have borne him six sons. She named him Zebulun.\r {BR}21  Afterwards, she bore a daughter, and named her Dinah.\r {BR}22  God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her, and opened her womb.\r {BR}23  She conceived, bore a son, and said, God has taken away my reproach.\r {BR}24  She named him Joseph, saying, May Yahweh add another son to me.\r {BR}25  It happened, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country.\r {BR}26  Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know my service with which I have served you.\r {BR}27  Laban said to him, If now I have found favor in your eyes, stay here, for I have divined that Yahweh has blessed me for your sake.\r {BR}28  He said, Appoint me your wages, and I will give it.\r {BR}29  He said to him, You know how I have served you, and how your livestock have fared with me.\r {BR}30  For it was little which you had before I came, and it has increased to a multitude. Yahweh has blessed you wherever I turned. Now when will I provide for my own house also?\r {BR}31  He said, What shall I give you? Jacob said, You shall not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed your flock and keep it.\r {BR}32  I will pass through all your flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats. This will be my hire.\r {BR}33  So my righteousness will answer for me hereafter, when you come concerning my hire that is before you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that might be with me, will be counted stolen.\r {BR}34  Laban said, Behold, I desire it to be according to your word.\r {BR}35  That day, he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.\r {BR}36  He set three days' journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.\r {BR}37  Jacob took to himself rods of fresh poplar, almond, plane tree, peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.\r {BR}38  He set the rods which he had peeled opposite the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink. They conceived when they came to drink.\r {BR}39  The flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth streaked, speckled, and spotted.\r {BR}40  Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the black in the flock of Laban: and he put his own droves apart, and didn't put them into Laban's flock.\r {BR}41  It happened, whenever the stronger of the flock conceived, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods;\r {BR}42  but when the flock were feeble, he didn't put them in. So the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.\r {BR}43  The man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.\r {BR}{BR}{I}{B}WEB\\Genesis\\31:1-55{/I}{/B}{BR}{BR}1  He heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob has taken away all that was our father's. From that which was our father's, has he gotten all this wealth.\r {BR}2  Jacob saw the expression on Laban's face, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.\r {BR}3  Yahweh said to Jacob, Return to the land of your fathers, and to your relatives, and I will be with you.\r {BR}4  Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock,\r {BR}5  and said to them, I see the expression on your father's face, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father has been with me.\r {BR}6  You know that I have served your father with all of my strength.\r {BR}7  Your father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times, but God didn't allow him to hurt me.\r {BR}8  If he said this, 'The speckled will be your wages,' then all the flock bore speckled. If he said this, 'The streaked will be your wages,' then all the flock bore streaked.\r {BR}9  Thus God has taken away your father's livestock, and given them to me.\r {BR}10  It happened during mating season that I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and behold, the male goats which leaped on the flock were streaked, speckled, and grizzled.\r {BR}11  The angel of God said to me in the dream, 'Jacob,' and I said, 'Here I am.'\r {BR}12  He said, 'Now lift up your eyes, and behold, all the male goats which leap on the flock are streaked, speckled, and grizzled, for I have seen all that Laban does to you.\r {BR}13  I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you vowed a vow to me. Now arise, get out from this land, and return to the land of your birth.' \r {BR}14  Rachel and Leah answered him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?\r {BR}15  Aren't we accounted by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and has also quite devoured our money.\r {BR}16  For all the riches which God has taken away from our father, that is ours and our children's. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do.\r {BR}17  Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives on the camels,\r {BR}18  and he took away all his livestock, and all his possessions which he had gathered, including the livestock which he had gained in Paddan Aram, to go to Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan.\r {BR}19  Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep: and Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father's.\r {BR}20  Jacob deceived Laban the Syrian, in that he didn't tell him that he was running away.\r {BR}21  So he fled with all that he had. He rose up, passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.\r {BR}22  Laban was told on the third day that Jacob had fled.\r {BR}23  He took his relatives with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey. He overtook him in the mountain of Gilead.\r {BR}24  God came to Laban, the Syrian, in a dream of the night, and said to him, Take heed to yourself that you don't speak to Jacob either good or bad.\r {BR}25  Laban caught up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain, and Laban with his relatives encamped in the mountain of Gilead.\r {BR}26  Laban said to Jacob, What have you done, that you have deceived me, and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword?\r {BR}27  Why did you flee secretly, and deceive me, and didn't tell me, that I might have sent you away with mirth and with songs, with tambourine and with harp;\r {BR}28  and didn't allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now have you done foolishly.\r {BR}29  It is in the power of my hand to hurt you, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, 'Take heed to yourself that you don't speak to Jacob either good or bad.'\r {BR}30  Now, you want to be gone, because you greatly longed for your father's house, but why have you stolen my gods?\r {BR}31  Jacob answered Laban, Because I was afraid, for I said, 'Lest you should take your daughters from me by force.'\r {BR}32  Anyone you find your gods with shall not live. Before our relatives, discern what is yours with me, and take it. For Jacob didn't know that Rachel had stolen them.\r {BR}33  Laban went into Jacob's tent, into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two female servants; but he didn't find them. He went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.\r {BR}34  Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, put them in the camel's saddle, and sat on them. Laban felt about all the tent, but didn't find them.\r {BR}35  She said to her father, Don't let my lord be angry that I can't rise up before you; for the manner of women is on me. He searched, but didn't find the teraphim.\r {BR}36  Jacob was angry, and argued with Laban. Jacob answered Laban, What is my trespass? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued after me?\r {BR}37  Now that you have felt around in all my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? Set it here before my relatives and your relatives, that they may judge between us two.\r {BR}38  These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female goats have not cast their young, and I haven't eaten the rams of your flocks.\r {BR}39  That which was torn of animals, I didn't bring to you. I bore its loss. Of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.\r {BR}40  This was my situation: in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from my eyes.\r {BR}41  These twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.\r {BR}42  Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night.\r {BR}43  Laban answered Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine: and what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne?\r {BR}44  Now come, let us make a covenant, you and I; and let it be for a witness between me and you.\r {BR}45  Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.\r {BR}46  Jacob said to his relatives, Gather stones. They took stones, and made a heap. They ate there by the heap.\r {BR}47  Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.\r {BR}48  Laban said, This heap is witness between me and you this day. Therefore it was named Galeed\r {BR}49  and Mizpah, for he said, Yahweh watch between me and you, when we are absent one from another.\r {BR}50  If you afflict my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, no man is with us; behold, God is witness between me and you.\r {BR}51  Laban said to Jacob, See this heap, and see the pillar, which I have set between me and you.\r {BR}52  May this heap be a witness, and the pillar be a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.\r {BR}53  The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us. Then Jacob swore by the fear of his father, Isaac.\r {BR}54  Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his relatives to eat bread. They ate bread, and stayed all night in the mountain.\r {BR}55  Early in the morning, Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them.

So it was done to them.\r {BR}26  They loaded their donkeys with their grain, and departed from there.\r {BR}27  As one of them opened his sack to give his donkey food in the lodging place, he saw his money. Behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.\r {BR}28  He said to his brothers, My money is restored! Behold, it is in my sack! Their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying, What is this that God has done to us?\r {BR}29  They came to Jacob their father, to the land of Canaan, and told him all that had happened to them, saying,\r {BR}30  The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.\r {BR}31  We said to him, 'We are honest men. We are no spies.\r {BR}32  We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no more, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.'\r {BR}33  The man, the lord of the land, said to us, 'By this I will know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your houses, and go your way.\r {BR}34  Bring your youngest brother to me. Then I will know that you are not spies, but that you are honest men. So I will deliver your brother to you, and you shall trade in the land.' \r {BR}35  It happened as they emptied their sacks, that behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack. When they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.\r {BR}36  Jacob, their father, said to them, You have bereaved me of my children! Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more, and you want to take Benjamin away. All these things are against me.\r {BR}37  Reuben spoke to his father, saying, Kill my two sons, if I don't bring him to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him to you again.\r {BR}38  He said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left. If harm happens to him along the way in which you go, then you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.\r {BR}{BR}{I}{B}WEB\\Genesis\\43{/I}{/B}{BR}{BR}1  The famine was severe in the land.\r {BR}2  It happened, when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said to them, Go again, buy us a little more food.\r {BR}3  Judah spoke to him, saying, The man solemnly warned us, saying, 'You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.'\r {BR}4  If you'll send our brother with us, we'll go down and buy you food,\r {BR}5  but if you'll not send him, we'll not go down, for the man said to us, 'You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.' \r {BR}6  Israel said, Why did you treat me so badly, telling the man that you had another brother?\r {BR}7  They said, The man asked directly concerning ourselves, and concerning our relatives, saying, 'Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?' We just answered his questions. Is there any way we could know that he would say, 'Bring your brother down?' \r {BR}8  Judah said to Israel, his father, Send the boy with me, and we'll get up and go, so that we may live, and not die, both we, and you, and also our little ones.\r {BR}9  I'll be collateral for him. From my hand will you require him. If I don't bring him to you, and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever,\r {BR}10  for if we hadn't delayed, surely we would have returned a second time by now.\r {BR}11  Their father, Israel, said to them, If it must be so, then do this. Take from the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry down a present for the man, a little balm, a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts, and almonds;\r {BR}12  and take double money in your hand, and take back the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it was an oversight.\r {BR}13  Take your brother also, get up, and return to the man.\r {BR}14  May God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release to you your other brother and Benjamin. If I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.\r {BR}15  The men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and got up, went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.\r {BR}16  When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, Bring the men into the house, and butcher an animal, and make ready; for the men will dine with me at noon.\r {BR}17  The man did as Joseph commanded, and the man brought the men to Joseph's house.\r {BR}18  The men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time, we're brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, attack us, and seize us as slaves, along with our donkeys.\r {BR}19  They came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they spoke to him at the door of the house,\r {BR}20  and said, Oh, my lord, we indeed came down the first time to buy food.\r {BR}21  When we came to the lodging place, we opened our sacks, and behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight. We have brought it back in our hand.\r {BR}22  We have brought down other money in our hand to buy food. We don't know who put our money in our sacks.\r {BR}23  He said, Peace be to you. Don't be afraid. Your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks. I received your money. He brought Simeon out to them.\r {BR}24  The man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet. He gave their donkeys fodder.\r {BR}25  They made ready the present for Joseph's coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.\r {BR}26  When Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves down to him to the earth.\r {BR}27  He asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he yet alive?\r {BR}28  They said, Your servant, our father, is well. He is still alive. They bowed the head, and did homage.\r {BR}29  He lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin, his brother, his mother's son, and said, Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me? He said, God be gracious to you, my son.\r {BR}30  Joseph hurried, for his heart yearned over his brother; and he sought a place to weep. He entered into his room, and wept there.\r {BR}31  He washed his face, and came out. He controlled himself, and said, Serve the meal.\r {BR}32  They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians, that ate with him, by themselves, because the Egyptians don't eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.\r {BR}33  They sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth, and the men marveled one with another.\r {BR}34  He sent portions to them from before him, but Benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of theirs. They drank, and were merry with him.\r {BR}{BR}{I}{B}WEB\\Genesis\\44{/I}{/B}{BR}{BR}1  He commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.\r {BR}2  Put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, with his grain money. He did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.\r {BR}3  As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys.\r {BR}4  When they had gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, Up, follow after the men. When you overtake them, ask them, 'Why have you rewarded evil for good?\r {BR}5  Isn't this that from which my lord drinks, and by which he indeed divines? You have done evil in so doing.' \r {BR}6  He overtook them, and he spoke these words to them.\r {BR}7  They said to him, Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing!\r {BR}8  Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan. How then should we steal silver or gold out of your lord's house?\r {BR}9  With whoever of your servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondservants.\r {BR}10  He said, Now also let it be according to your words: he with whom it is found will be my bondservant; and you will be blameless.\r {BR}11  Then they hurried, and every man took his sack down to the ground, and every man opened his sack.\r {BR}12  He searched, beginning with the eldest, and ending at the youngest. The cup was found in Benjamin's sack.\r {BR}13  Then they tore their clothes, and every man loaded his donkey, and returned to the city.\r {BR}14  Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house, and he was still there. They fell on the ground before him.\r {BR}15  Joseph said to them, What deed is this that you have done? Don't you know that such a man as I can indeed divine?\r {BR}16  Judah said, What will we tell my lord? What will we speak? Or how will we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants. Behold, we are my lord's bondservants, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found.\r {BR}17  He said, Far be it from me that I should do so. The man in whose hand the cup is found, he will be my bondservant; but as for you, go up in peace to your father.\r {BR}18  Then Judah came near to him, and said, Oh, my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my lord's ears, and don't let your anger burn against your servant; for you are even as Pharaoh.\r {BR}19  My lord asked his servants, saying, 'Have you a father, or a brother?'\r {BR}20  We said to my lord, 'We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loves him.'\r {BR}21  You said to your servants, 'Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.'\r {BR}22  We said to my lord, 'The boy can't leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.'\r {BR}23  You said to your servants, 'Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will see my face no more.'\r {BR}24  It happened when we came up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.\r {BR}25  Our father said, 'Go again, buy us a little food.'\r {BR}26  We said, 'We can't go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down: for we may not see the man's face, unless our youngest brother is with us.'\r {BR}27  Your servant, my father, said to us, 'You know that my wife bore me two sons:\r {BR}28  and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I haven't seen him since.\r {BR}29  If you take this one also from me, and harm happens to him, you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.'\r {BR}30  Now therefore when I come to your servant my father, and the boy is not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the boy's life;\r {BR}31  it will happen, when he sees that the boy is no more, that he will die. Your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant, our father, with sorrow to Sheol.\r {BR}32  For your servant became collateral for the boy to my father, saying, 'If I don't bring him to you, then I will bear the blame to my father forever.'\r {BR}33  Now therefore, please let your servant stay instead of the boy, a bondservant to my lord; and let the boy go up with his brothers.\r {BR}34  For how will I go up to my father, if the boy isn't with me?--lest I see the evil that will come on my father.\r {BR}{BR}{I}{B}WEB\\Genesis\\45{/I}{/B}{BR}{BR}1  Then Joseph couldn't control himself before all those who stood before him, and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me!

The Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.\r {BR}3  Joseph said to his brothers, I am Joseph! Does my father still live? His brothers couldn't answer him; for they were terrified at his presence.\r {BR}4  Joseph said to his brothers, Come near to me, please. They came near. He said, I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt.\r {BR}5  Now don't be grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that you sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life.\r {BR}6  For these two years the famine has been in the land, and there are yet five years, in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest.\r {BR}7  God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance.\r {BR}8  So now it wasn't you who sent me here, but God, and he has made me a father to Pharaoh, lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.\r {BR}9  Hurry, and go up to my father, and tell him, 'This is what your son Joseph says, God has made me lord of all Egypt.

After that his brothers talked with him.\r {BR}16  The report of it was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brothers have come. It pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.\r {BR}17  Pharaoh said to Joseph, Tell your brothers, 'Do this.

Take wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.\r {BR}20  Also, don't concern yourselves about your belongings, for the good of all of the land of Egypt is yours.\r {BR}21  The sons of Israel did so. Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.\r {BR}22  He gave each one of them changes of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing.\r {BR}23  To his father, he sent after this manner: ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way.\r {BR}24  So he sent his brothers away, and they departed.

When he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob, their father, revived.\r {BR}28  Israel said, It is enough. Joseph my son is still alive.

They were very grievous. Before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.\r {BR}15  For they covered the surface of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened, and they ate every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left. There remained nothing green, either tree or herb of the field, through all the land of Egypt.\r {BR}16  Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste, and he said, I have sinned against Yahweh your God, and against you.\r {BR}17  Now therefore please forgive my sin again, and pray to Yahweh your God, that he may also take away from me this death.\r {BR}18  He went out from Pharaoh, and prayed to Yahweh.\r {BR}19  Yahweh turned an exceeding strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea. There remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt.\r {BR}20  But Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he didn't let the children of Israel go.\r {BR}21  Yahweh said to Moses, Stretch out your hand toward the sky, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.\r {BR}22  Moses stretched forth his hand toward the sky, and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days.\r {BR}23  They didn't see one another, neither did anyone rise from his place for three days; but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.\r {BR}24  Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, Go, serve Yahweh.

Let us get the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of Shiloh to us, that it may come among us, and save us out of the hand of our enemies.\r {BR}4  So the people sent to Shiloh; and they brought from there the ark of the covenant of Yahweh of Armies, who sits ({I}{B}above{/B}{/I}) the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.\r {BR}5  When the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.\r {BR}6  When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What means the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? They understood that the ark of Yahweh was come into the camp.\r {BR}7  The Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. They said, Woe to us! for there has not been such a thing heretofore.\r {BR}8  Woe to us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? these are the gods that struck the Egyptians with all manner of plagues in the wilderness.\r {BR}9  Be strong, and behave like men, O you Philistines, that you not be servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you.

When the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.\r {BR}14  When Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What means the noise of this tumult? The man hurried, and came and told Eli.\r {BR}15  Now Eli was ninety-eight years old; and his eyes were set, so that he could not see.\r {BR}16  The man said to Eli, I am he who came out of the army, and I fled today out of the army. He said, How went the matter, my son?\r {BR}17  He who brought the news answered, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter among the people, and your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.\r {BR}18  It happened, when he made mention of the ark of God, that ({I}{B}Eli{/B}{/I}) fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck broke, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy.

From his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.\r {BR}3  The donkeys of Kish, Saul's father, were lost. Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with you, and arise, go seek the donkeys.\r {BR}4  He passed through the hill country of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they didn't find them: then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and there they weren't there: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they didn't find them.\r {BR}5  When they had come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, Come, and let us return, lest my father leave off caring for the donkeys, and be anxious for us.\r {BR}6  He said to him, See now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is a man who is held in honor; all that he says comes surely to pass: now let us go there; peradventure he can tell us concerning our journey whereon we go.\r {BR}7  Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?\r {BR}8  The servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.\r {BR}9  (In earlier times in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he said, Come, and let us go to the seer; for he who is now called a prophet was before called a Seer.)\r {BR}10  Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went to the city where the man of God was.\r {BR}11  As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said to them, Is the seer here?\r {BR}12  They answered them, and said, He is; behold, ({I}{B}he is{/B}{/I}) before you: make haste now, for he is come today into the city; for the people have a sacrifice today in the high place:\r {BR}13  as soon as you have come into the city, you shall immediately find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he come, because he does bless the sacrifice; ({I}{B}and{/B}{/I}) afterwards they eat who are invited.

For whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for you, and for all your father's house?\r {BR}21  Saul answered, Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? why then speak you to me after this manner?\r {BR}22  Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the guest room, and made them sit in the best place among those who were invited, who were about thirty persons.\r {BR}23  Samuel said to the cook, Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said to you, Set it aside.\r {BR}24  The cook took up the thigh, and that which was on it, and set it before Saul.

Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.\r {BR}27  As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us  (and he passed on), but stand still first, that I may cause you to hear the word of God.\r {BR}{BR}{I}{B}WEB\\1 Samuel\\10{/I}{/B}{BR}{BR}1  Then Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him, and said, Isn't it that Yahweh has anointed you to be prince over his inheritance?\r {BR}2  When you have departed from me today, then you shall find two men by Rachel's tomb, in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will tell you, The donkeys which you went to seek have been found; and behold, your father has stopped caring about the donkeys, and is anxious for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?\r {BR}3  Then you shall go on forward from there, and you shall come to the oak of Tabor; and three men shall meet you there going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:\r {BR}4  and they will greet you, and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall receive of their hand.\r {BR}5  After that you shall come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall happen, when you have come there to the city, that you shall meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tambourine, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they will be prophesying:\r {BR}6  and the Spirit of Yahweh will come mightily on you, and you shall prophesy with them, and shall be turned into another man.\r {BR}7  Let it be, when these signs have come to you, that you do as occasion shall serve you; for God is with you.\r {BR}8  You shall go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to you, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: you shall wait seven days, until I come to you, and show you what you shall do.\r {BR}9  It was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs happened that day.\r {BR}10  When they came there to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came mightily on him, and he prophesied among them.\r {BR}11  It happened, when all who knew him before saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?\r {BR}12  One of the same place answered, Who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?\r {BR}13  When he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.\r {BR}14  Saul's uncle said to him and to his servant, Where did you go? He said, To seek the donkeys; and when we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel.\r {BR}15  Saul's uncle said, Tell me, Please, what Samuel said to you.\r {BR}16  Saul said to his uncle, He told us plainly that the donkeys were found. But concerning the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel spoke, he didn't tell him.\r {BR}17  Samuel called the people together to Yahweh to Mizpah;\r {BR}18  and he said to the children of Israel, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you:\r {BR}19  but you have this day rejected your God, who himself saves you out of all your calamities and your distresses; and you have said to him, ({I}{B}No{/B}{/I}), but set a king over us.

Yahweh answered, Behold, he has hid himself among the baggage.\r {BR}23  They ran and fetched him there; and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.\r {BR}24  Samuel said to all the people, You see him whom Yahweh has chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? All the people shouted, and said, ({I}{B}Long{/B}{/I}) live the king.\r {BR}25  Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before Yahweh.

The people didn't know that Jonathan was gone.\r {BR}4  Between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines' garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.\r {BR}5  The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.\r {BR}6  Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that Yahweh will work for us; for there is no restraint to Yahweh to save by many or by few.\r {BR}7  His armor bearer said to him, Do all that is in your heart: turn and, behold, I am with you according to your heart.\r {BR}8  Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over to the men, and we will disclose ourselves to them.\r {BR}9  If they say thus to us, Wait until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up to them.\r {BR}10  But if they say thus, Come up to us; then we will go up; for Yahweh has delivered them into our hand: and this shall be the sign to us.\r {BR}11  Both of them disclosed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.\r {BR}12  The men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor bearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. Jonathan said to his armor bearer, Come up after me; for Yahweh has delivered them into the hand of Israel.\r {BR}13  Jonathan climbed up on his hands and on his feet, and his armor bearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armor bearer killed them after him.\r {BR}14  That first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were half a furrow's length in an acre of land.\r {BR}15  There was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled; and the earth quaked: so there was an exceeding great trembling.\r {BR}16  The watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and behold, the multitude melted away, and they went ({I}{B}here{/B}{/I}) and there.\r {BR}17  Then said Saul to the people who were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. When they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there.\r {BR}18  Saul said to Ahijah, Bring here the ark of God. For the ark of God was ({I}{B}there{/B}{/I}) at that time with the children of Israel.\r {BR}19  It happened, while Saul talked to the priest, that the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said to the priest, Withdraw your hand.\r {BR}20  Saul and all the people who were with him were gathered together, and came to the battle: and behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, ({I}{B}and there was{/B}{/I}) a very great confusion.\r {BR}21  Now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines as before, and who went up with them into the camp, ({I}{B}from the country{/B}{/I}) all around, even they also ({I}{B}turned{/B}{/I}) to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.\r {BR}22  Likewise all the men of Israel who had hid themselves in the hill country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.\r {BR}23  So Yahweh saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over by Beth Aven.\r {BR}24  The men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man who eats any food until it be evening, and I be avenged on my enemies. So none of the people tasted food.\r {BR}25  All the people came into the forest; and there was honey on the ground.\r {BR}26  When the people were come to the forest, behold, the honey dropped: but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the people feared the oath.\r {BR}27  But Jonathan didn't hear when his father commanded the people with the oath: therefore he put forth the end of the rod who was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.\r {BR}28  Then answered one of the people, and said, Your father directly commanded the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man who eats food this day. The people were faint.\r {BR}29  Then said Jonathan, My father has troubled the land. Please look how my eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.\r {BR}30  How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for now has there been no great slaughter among the Philistines.\r {BR}31  They struck of the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. The people were very faint;\r {BR}32  and the people flew on the spoil, and took sheep, and cattle, and calves, and killed them on the ground; and the people ate them with the blood.\r {BR}33  Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against Yahweh, in that they eat with the blood. He said, you have dealt treacherously: roll a great stone to me this day.\r {BR}34  Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and tell them, Bring me here every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and kill them here, and eat; and don't sin against Yahweh in eating with the blood.

They said, Do whatever seems good to you. Then said the priest, Let us draw near here to God.\r {BR}37  Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? will you deliver them into the hand of Israel?

But there was not a man among all the people who answered him.\r {BR}40  Then said he to all Israel, You be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. The people said to Saul, Do what seems good to you.\r {BR}41  Therefore Saul said to Yahweh, the God of Israel, Show the right. Jonathan and Saul were taken ({I}{B}by lot{/B}{/I}); but the people escaped.\r {BR}42  Saul said, Cast ({I}{B}lots{/B}{/I}) between me and Jonathan my son. Jonathan was taken.\r {BR}43  Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what you have done. Jonathan told him, and said, I did certainly taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; and behold, I must die.\r {BR}44  Saul said, God do so and more also; for you shall surely die, Jonathan.\r {BR}45  The people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Israel? Far from it: as Yahweh lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he has worked with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he didn't die.\r {BR}46  Then Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.\r {BR}47  Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and wherever he turned himself, he put ({I}{B}them{/B}{/I}) to the worse.\r {BR}48  He did valiantly, and struck the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who despoiled them.\r {BR}49  Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchishua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:\r {BR}50  and the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the captain of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.\r {BR}51  Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.\r {BR}52  There was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man, he took him to him.\r {BR}{BR}"},{scriptures:"1 Samuel\\15",id:"40",title:"Saul's Disobedience",verses:"{I}{B}WEB\\1 Samuel\\15{/I}{/B}{BR}{BR}1  Samuel said to Saul, Yahweh sent me to anoint you to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore listen you to the voice of the words of Yahweh.\r {BR}2  Thus says Yahweh of Armies, I have marked that which Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him in the way, when he came up out of Egypt.\r {BR}3  Now go and strike Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and don't spare them; but kill both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.\r {BR}4  Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.\r {BR}5  Saul came to the city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.\r {BR}6  Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, go down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for you showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt.

Because he curses, and because Yahweh has said to him, Curse David; who then shall say, Why have you done so?\r {BR}11  David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeks my life: how much more ({I}{B}may{/B}{/I}) this Benjamite now ({I}{B}do it{/B}{/I})? let him alone, and let him curse; for Yahweh has invited him.\r {BR}12  It may be that Yahweh will look on the wrong done to me, and that Yahweh will requite me good for ({I}{B}his{/B}{/I}) cursing of me this day.\r {BR}13  So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hillside over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.\r {BR}14  The king, and all the people who were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there.\r {BR}15  Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.\r {BR}16  It happened, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, ({I}{B}Long{/B}{/I}) live the king, ({I}{B}Long{/B}{/I}) live the king.\r {BR}17  Absalom said to Hushai, Is this your kindness to your friend? Why didn't you go with your friend?\r {BR}18  Hushai said to Absalom, No; but whom Yahweh, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him will I abide.\r {BR}19  Again, whom should I serve? Shouldn't I serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in your father's presence, so will I be in your presence.\r {BR}20  Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give your counsel what we shall do.\r {BR}21  Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to your father's concubines, that he has left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that you are abhorred by your father: then the hands of all who are with you will be strong.\r {BR}22  So they spread Absalom a tent on the top of the house; and Absalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.\r {BR}23  The counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.\r {BR}{BR}{I}{B}WEB\\2 Samuel\\17{/I}{/B}{BR}{BR}1  Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:\r {BR}2  and I will come on him while he is weary and exhausted, and will make him afraid; and all the people who are with him shall flee; and I will strike the king only;\r {BR}3  and I will bring back all the people to you: the man whom you seek is as if all returned: ({I}{B}so{/B}{/I}) all the people shall be in peace.\r {BR}4  The saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.\r {BR}5  Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he says.\r {BR}6  When Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, Ahithophel has spoken after this manner: shall we do ({I}{B}after{/B}{/I}) his saying? if not, speak up.\r {BR}7  Hushai said to Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel has given this time is not good.\r {BR}8  Hushai said moreover, You know your father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are fierce in their minds, as a bear robbed of her cubs in the field; and your father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.\r {BR}9  Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some ({I}{B}other{/B}{/I}) place: and it will happen, when some of them are fallen at the first, that whoever hears it will say, There is a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom.\r {BR}10  Even he who is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and those who are with him are valiant men.\r {BR}11  But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together to you, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that you go to battle in your own person.\r {BR}12  So shall we come on him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light on him as the dew falls on the ground; and of him and of all the men who are with him we will not leave so much as one.\r {BR}13  Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there not be one small stone found there.\r {BR}14  Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For Yahweh had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that Yahweh might bring evil on Absalom.\r {BR}15  Then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Ahithophel counseled Absalom and the elders of Israel that way; and I have counseled this way.\r {BR}16  Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Don't lodge this night at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people who are with him.\r {BR}17  Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En Rogel; and a female servant used to go and tell them; and they went and told king David: for they might not be seen to come into the city.\r {BR}18  But a boy saw them, and told Absalom: and they went both of them away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down there.\r {BR}19  The woman took and spread the covering over the well's mouth, and strewed bruised grain thereon; and nothing was known.\r {BR}20  Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house; and they said, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? The woman said to them, They have gone over the brook of water. When they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.\r {BR}21  It happened, after they had departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David; and they said to David, Arise and pass quickly over the water; for thus has Ahithophel counseled against you.\r {BR}22  Then David arose, and all the people who were with him, and they passed over the Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them who had not gone over the Jordan.\r {BR}23  When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey, and arose, and got him home, to his city, and set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died, and was buried in the tomb of his father.\r {BR}24  Then David came to Mahanaim. Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.\r {BR}25  Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab's mother.\r {BR}26  Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.\r {BR}27  It happened, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,\r {BR}28  brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and meal, and parched ({I}{B}grain{/B}{/I}), and beans, and lentils, and parched ({I}{B}pulse{/B}{/I}),\r {BR}29  and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David, and for the people who were with him, to eat: for they said, The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.\r {BR}{BR}{I}{B}WEB\\2 Samuel\\18{/I}{/B}{BR}{BR}1  David numbered the people who were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.\r {BR}2  David sent forth the people, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. The king said to the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.\r {BR}3  But the people said, You shall not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but you are worth ten thousand of us; therefore now it is better that you are ready to help us out of the city.\r {BR}4  The king said to them, I will do what seems best to you. The king stood beside the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.\r {BR}5  The king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. All the people heard when the king commanded all the captains concerning Absalom.\r {BR}6  So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.\r {BR}7  The people of Israel were struck there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men.\r {BR}8  For the battle was there spread over the surface of all the country; and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.\r {BR}9  Absalom happened to meet the servants of David. Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the sky and earth; and the mule that was under him went on.\r {BR}10  A certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.\r {BR}11  Joab said to the man who told him, Behold, you saw it, and why didn't you strike him there to the ground? and I would have given you ten ({I}{B}pieces of{/B}{/I}) silver, and a sash.\r {BR}12  The man said to Joab, Though I should receive a thousand ({I}{B}pieces of{/B}{/I}) silver in my hand, I still wouldn't put forth my hand against the king's son; for in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.\r {BR}13  Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life  (and there is no matter hid from the king), then you yourself would have set yourself against ({I}{B}me{/B}{/I}).\r {BR}14  Then said Joab, I may not wait thus with you. He took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.\r {BR}15  Ten young men who bore Joab's armor surrounded and struck Absalom, and killed him.\r {BR}16  Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held back the people.\r {BR}17  They took Absalom, and cast him into the great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones: and all Israel fled everyone to his tent.\r {BR}18  Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself the pillar, which is in the king's dale; for he said, I have no son to keep my name in memory: and he called the pillar after his own name; and it is called Absalom's monument, to this day.\r {BR}19  Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king news, how that Yahweh has avenged him of his enemies.\r {BR}20  Joab said to him, You shall not be the bearer of news this day, but you shall bear news another day; but this day you shall bear no news, because the king's son is dead.\r {BR}21  Then said Joab to the Cushite, Go, tell the king what you have seen. The Cushite bowed himself to Joab, and ran.\r {BR}22  Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But come what may, Please let me also run after the Cushite. Joab said, Why will you run, my son, seeing that you will have no reward for the news?\r {BR}23  But come what may, ({I}{B}said he{/B}{/I}), I will run. He said to him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain, and outran the Cushite.\r {BR}24  Now David was sitting between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate to the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man running alone.\r {BR}25  The watchman cried, and told the king. The king said, If he be alone, there is news in his mouth. He came apace, and drew near.\r {BR}26  The watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called to the porter, and said, Behold, ({I}{B}another{/B}{/I}) man running alone. The king said, He also brings news.\r {BR}27  The watchman said, I think the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. The king said, He is a good man, and comes with good news.\r {BR}28  Ahimaaz called, and said to the king, All is well. He bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth, and said, Blessed be Yahweh your God, who has delivered up the men who lifted up their hand against my lord the king.\r {BR}29  The king said, Is it well with the young man Absalom? Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, even me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I don't know what it was.\r {BR}30  The king said, Turn aside, and stand here. He turned aside, and stood still.\r {BR}31  Behold, the Cushite came; and the Cushite said, News for my lord the king; for Yahweh has avenged you this day of all those who rose up against you.\r {BR}32  The king said to the Cushite, Is it well with the young man Absalom? The Cushite answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise up against you to do you hurt, be as that young man is.\r {BR}33  The king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would I had died for you, Absalom, my son, my son!\r {BR}{BR}{I}{B}WEB\\2 Samuel\\19{/I}{/B}{BR}{BR}1  It was told Joab, Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Absalom.\r {BR}2  The victory that day was turned into mourning to all the people; for the people heard say that day, The king grieves for his son.\r {BR}3  The people got them by stealth that day into the city, as people who are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.\r {BR}4  The king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, my son Absalom, Absalom, my son, my son!\r {BR}5  Joab came into the house to the king, and said, You have shamed this day the faces of all your servants, who this day have saved your life, and the lives of your sons and of your daughters, and the lives of your wives, and the lives of your concubines;\r {BR}6  in that you love those who hate you, and hate those who love you. For you have declared this day, that princes and servants are nothing to you: for this day I perceive that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased you well.\r {BR}7  Now therefore arise, go out, and speak to comfort your servants; for I swear by Yahweh, if you don't go out, not a man will stay with you this night: and that would be worse to you than all the evil that has happened to you from your youth until now.\r {BR}8  Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. They told to all the people, saying, Behold, the king is sitting in the gate: and all the people came before the king. Now Israel had fled every man to his tent.\r {BR}9  All the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land from Absalom.\r {BR}10  Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why don't you speak a word of bringing the king back?\r {BR}11  King David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, ({I}{B}to bring him{/B}{/I}) to his house.\r {BR}12  You are my brothers, you are my bone and my flesh: why then are you the last to bring back the king?\r {BR}13  Say to Amasa, Aren't you my bone and my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if you aren't captain of the army before me continually in the room of Joab.\r {BR}14  He bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as ({I}{B}the heart of{/B}{/I}) one man; so that they sent to the king, ({I}{B}saying{/B}{/I}), Return, you and all your servants.\r {BR}15  So the king returned, and came to the Jordan. Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan.\r {BR}16  Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.\r {BR}17  There were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king.\r {BR}18  A ferry boat went to bring over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, when he was come over the Jordan.\r {BR}19  He said to the king, Don't let my lord impute iniquity to me, neither do you remember that which your servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.\r {BR}20  For your servant does know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I have come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.\r {BR}21  But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered, Shall Shimei not be put to death for this, because he cursed Yahweh's anointed?\r {BR}22  David said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should this day be adversaries to me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for don't I know that I am this day king over Israel?\r {BR}23  The king said to Shimei, You shall not die. The king swore to him.\r {BR}24  Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; and he had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace.\r {BR}25  It happened, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, Why didn't you go with me, Mephibosheth?\r {BR}26  He answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for your servant said, I will saddle me a donkey, that I may ride thereon, and go with the king; because your servant is lame.\r {BR}27  He has slandered your servant to my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in your eyes.\r {BR}28  For all my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king; yet you set your servant among those who ate at your own table. What right therefore have I yet that I should cry any more to the king?\r {BR}29  The king said to him, Why do you speak any more of your matters? I say, You and Ziba divide the land.\r {BR}30  Mephibosheth said to the king, yes, let him take all, because my lord the king is come in peace to his own house.\r {BR}31  Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went over the Jordan with the king, to conduct him over the Jordan.\r {BR}32  Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even eighty years old: and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.\r {BR}33  The king said to Barzillai, Come over with me, and I will sustain you with me in Jerusalem.\r {BR}34  Barzillai said to the king, How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?\r {BR}35  I am this day eighty years old: can I discern between good and bad? can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? why then should your servant be yet a burden to my lord the king?\r {BR}36  Your servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?\r {BR}37  Please let your servant turn back again, that I may die in my own city, by the grave of my father and my mother. But behold, your servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good to you.\r {BR}38  The king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good to you: and whatever you shall require of me, that will I do for you.\r {BR}39  All the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over: and the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned to his own place.\r {BR}40  So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went over with him: and all the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half the people of Israel.\r {BR}41  Behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king, Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away, and brought the king, and his household, over the Jordan, and all David's men with him?\r {BR}42  All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is a close relative to us: why then are you angry for this matter? have we eaten at all at the king's cost? or has he given us any gift?\r {BR}43  The men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more ({I}{B}right{/B}{/I}) in David than you: why then did you despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? The words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.\r {BR}{BR}"},{scriptures:"1 Kings\\3",id:"49",title:"Solomon's Wisdom",verses:"{I}{B}WEB\\1 Kings\\3{/I}{/B}{BR}{BR}1  Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of Yahweh, and the wall of Jerusalem all around.\r {BR}2  Only the people sacrificed in the high places, because there was no house built for the name of Yahweh until those days.\r {BR}3  Solomon loved Yahweh, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.\r {BR}4  The king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer on that altar.\r {BR}5  In Gibeon Yahweh appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, Ask what I shall give you.\r {BR}6  Solomon said, You have shown to your servant David my father great loving kindness, according as he walked before you in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with you; and you have kept for him this great loving kindness, that you have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.\r {BR}7  Now, Yahweh my God, you have made your servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child; I don't know how to go out or come in.\r {BR}8  Your servant is in the midst of your people which you have chosen, a great people, that can't be numbered nor counted for multitude.\r {BR}9  Give your servant therefore an understanding heart to judge your people, that I may discern between good and evil; for who is able to judge this your great people?\r {BR}10  The speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.\r {BR}11  God said to him, Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked for yourself long life, neither have asked riches for yourself, nor have asked the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice;\r {BR}12  behold, I have done according to your word: behold, I have given you a wise and an understanding heart; so that there has been none like you before you, neither after you shall any arise like you.\r {BR}13  I have also given you that which you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that there shall not be any among the kings like you, all your days.\r {BR}14  If you will walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as your father David walked, then I will lengthen your days.\r {BR}15  Solomon awoke; and behold, it was a dream: and he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.\r {BR}16  Then there came two women who were prostitutes, to the king, and stood before him.\r {BR}17  The one woman said, Oh, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.\r {BR}18  It happened the third day after I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also; and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.\r {BR}19  This woman's child died in the night, because she lay on it.\r {BR}20  She arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while your handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.\r {BR}21  When I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead; but when I had looked at it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, whom I bore.\r {BR}22  The other woman said, No; but the living is my son, and the dead is your son.

So they listened to the word of Yahweh, and returned and went their way, according to the word of Yahweh.\r {BR}25  Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and lived therein; and he went out from there, and built Penuel.\r {BR}26  Jeroboam said in his heart, Now will the kingdom return to the house of David:\r {BR}27  if this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem, then will the heart of this people turn again to their lord, even to Rehoboam king of Judah; and they will kill me, and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.\r {BR}28  Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold; and he said to them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: see your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.\r {BR}29  He set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.\r {BR}30  This thing became a sin; for the people went ({I}{B}to worship{/B}{/I}) before the one, even to Dan.\r {BR}31  He made houses of high places, and made priests from among all the people, who were not of the sons of Levi.\r {BR}32  Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast that is in Judah, and he went up to the altar; so did he in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places that he had made.\r {BR}33  He went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart: and he ordained a feast for the children of Israel, and went up to the altar, to burn incense.\r {BR}{BR}{I}{B}WEB\\1 Kings\\13{/I}{/B}{BR}{BR}1  Behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of Yahweh to Beth El: and Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense.\r {BR}2  He cried against the altar by the word of Yahweh, and said, altar, altar, thus says Yahweh: Behold, a son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name; and on you shall he sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and men's bones shall they burn on you.\r {BR}3  He gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which Yahweh has spoken: Behold, the altar shall be torn, and the ashes that are on it shall be poured out.\r {BR}4  It happened, when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar in Bethel, that Jeroboam put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. His hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back again to him.\r {BR}5  The altar also was torn, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of Yahweh.\r {BR}6  The king answered the man of God, Entreat now the favor of Yahweh your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again.

(Now Obadiah feared Yahweh greatly:\r {BR}4  for it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Yahweh, that Obadiah took one hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)\r {BR}5  Ahab said to Obadiah, Go through the land, to all the springs of water, and to all the brooks: peradventure we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, that we not lose all the animals.\r {BR}6  So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.\r {BR}7  As Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Is it you, my lord Elijah?\r {BR}8  He answered him, It is I: go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah ({I}{B}is here{/B}{/I}).\r {BR}9  He said, Wherein have I sinned, that you would deliver your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me?\r {BR}10  As Yahweh your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom, where my lord has not sent to seek you: and when they said, He is not here, he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they didn't find you.\r {BR}11  Now you say, Go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah is here.\r {BR}12  It will happen, as soon as I am gone from you, that the Spirit of Yahweh will carry you I don't know where; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he can't find you, he will kill me: but I your servant have feared Yahweh from my youth.\r {BR}13  Wasn't it told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of Yahweh, how I hid one hundred men of Yahweh's prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?\r {BR}14  Now you say, Go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah ({I}{B}is here{/B}{/I}); and he will kill me.\r {BR}15  Elijah said, As Yahweh of Armies lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him today.\r {BR}16  So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.\r {BR}17  It happened, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, Is it you, you troubler of Israel?\r {BR}18  He answered, I have not troubled Israel; but you, and your father's house, in that you have forsaken the commandments of Yahweh, and you have followed the Baals.\r {BR}19  Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel to Mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred fifty, and the prophets of the Asherah four hundred, who eat at Jezebel's table.\r {BR}20  So Ahab sent to all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together to Mount Carmel.\r {BR}21  Elijah came near to all the people, and said, How long will you waver between the two sides?

Let cosmetics be given them;\r {BR}4  and let the maiden who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti. The thing pleased the king, and he did so.\r {BR}5  There was a certain Jew in the citadel of Susa, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite,\r {BR}6  who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.\r {BR}7  He brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter; for she had neither father nor mother. The maiden was fair and beautiful; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.\r {BR}8  So it happened, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together to the citadel of Susa, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.\r {BR}9  The maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness from him. He quickly gave her cosmetics and her portions of food, and the seven choice maidens who were to be given her out of the king's house. He moved her and her maidens to the best place in the women's house.\r {BR}10  Esther had not made known her people nor her relatives, because Mordecai had instructed her that she should not make it known.\r {BR}11  Mordecai walked every day in front of the court of the women's house, to find out how Esther did, and what would become of her.\r {BR}12  Each young woman's turn came to go in to King Ahasuerus after her purification for twelve months  (for so were the days of their purification accomplished, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet fragrances and with preparations for beautifying women).\r {BR}13  The young woman then came to the king like this: whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the women's house to the king's house.\r {BR}14  In the evening she went, and on the next day she returned into the second women's house, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch, who kept the concubines. She came in to the king no more, unless the king delighted in her, and she was called by name.\r {BR}15  Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, came to go in to the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's eunuch, the keeper of the women, advised. Esther obtained favor in the sight of all those who looked at her.\r {BR}16  So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.\r {BR}17  The king loved Esther more than all the women, and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.\r {BR}18  Then the king made a great feast for all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he proclaimed a holiday in the provinces, and gave gifts according to the king's bounty.\r {BR}19  When the virgins were gathered together the second time, Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate.\r {BR}20  Esther had not yet made known her relatives nor her people, as Mordecai had commanded her; for Esther obeyed Mordecai, like she did when she was brought up by him.\r {BR}21  In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate, two of the king's eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, who were doorkeepers, were angry, and sought to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus.\r {BR}22  This thing became known to Mordecai, who informed Esther the queen; and Esther informed the king in Mordecai's name.\r {BR}23  When this matter was investigated, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a tree; and it was written in the book of the chronicles in the king's presence.\r {BR}{BR}{I}{B}WEB\\Esther\\3{/I}{/B}{BR}{BR}1  After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes who were with him.\r {BR}2  All the king's servants who were in the king's gate bowed down, and paid homage to Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai didn't bow down or pay him homage.\r {BR}3  Then the king's servants, who were in the king's gate, said to Mordecai, Why do you disobey the king's commandment?\r {BR}4  Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him, and he didn't listen to them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's reason would stand; for he had told them that he was a Jew.\r {BR}5  When Haman saw that Mordecai didn't bow down, nor pay him homage, Haman was full of wrath.\r {BR}6  But he scorned the thought of laying hands on Mordecai alone, for they had made known to him Mordecai's people. Therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the Mordecai's people.\r {BR}7  In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, and chose the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.\r {BR}8  Haman said to King Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom, and their laws are different than other people's. They don't keep the king's laws. Therefore it is not for the king's profit to allow them to remain.\r {BR}9  If it pleases the king, let it be written that they be destroyed; and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who are in charge of the king's business, to bring it into the king's treasuries.\r {BR}10  The king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.\r {BR}11  The king said to Haman, The silver is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you.\r {BR}12  Then the king's scribes were called in on the first month, on the thirteenth day of the month; and all that Haman commanded was written to the king's satraps, and to the governors who were over every province, and to the princes of every people, to every province according its writing, and to every people in their language. It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus, and it was sealed with the king's ring.\r {BR}13  Letters were sent by couriers into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to plunder their possessions.\r {BR}14  A copy of the letter, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published to all the peoples, that they should be ready against that day.\r {BR}15  The couriers went forth in haste by the king's commandment, and the decree was given out in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Shushan was perplexed.\r {BR}{BR}{I}{B}WEB\\Esther\\4{/I}{/B}{BR}{BR}1  Now when Mordecai found out all that was done, Mordecai tore his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and wailed loudly and a bitterly.\r {BR}2  He came even before the king's gate, for no one is allowed inside the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.\r {BR}3  In every province, wherever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.\r {BR}4  Esther's maidens and her eunuchs came and told her this, and the queen was exceedingly grieved. She sent clothing to Mordecai, to replace his sackcloth; but he didn't receive it.\r {BR}5  Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs, whom he had appointed to attend her, and commanded him to go to Mordecai, to find out what this was, and why it was.\r {BR}6  So Hathach went out to Mordecai, to city square which was before the king's gate.\r {BR}7  Mordecai told him of all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the destruction of the Jews.\r {BR}8  He also gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy them, to show it to Esther, and to declare it to her, and to urge her to go in to the king, to make supplication to him, and to make request before him, for her people.\r {BR}9  Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.\r {BR}10  Then Esther spoke to Hathach, and gave him a message to Mordecai:\r {BR}11  All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, know, that whoever, whether man or woman, comes to the king into the inner court without being called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except those to whom the king might hold out the golden scepter, that he may live. I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days.\r {BR}12  They told to Mordecai Esther's words.\r {BR}13  Then Mordecai asked them return answer to Esther, Don't think to yourself that you will escape in the king's house any more than all the Jews.\r {BR}14  For if you remain silent now, then relief and deliverance will come to the Jews from another place, but you and your father's house will perish. Who knows if you haven't come to the kingdom for such a time as this?\r {BR}15  Then Esther asked them to answer Mordecai,\r {BR}16  Go, gather together all the Jews who are present in Shushan, and fast for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day. I and my maidens will also fast the same way. Then I will go in to the king, which is against the law; and if I perish, I perish.\r {BR}17  So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.\r {BR}{BR}{I}{B}WEB\\Esther\\5{/I}{/B}{BR}{BR}1  Now it happened on the third day that Esther put on her royal clothing, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, next to the king's house.

So Esther came near, and touched the top of the scepter.\r {BR}3  Then the king asked her, What would you like, queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given you even to the half of the kingdom.\r {BR}4  Esther said, If it seems good to the king, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.\r {BR}5  Then the king said, Bring Haman quickly, so that it may be done as Esther has said.

So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.\r {BR}11  Jesus took the loaves; and having given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were sitting down; likewise also of the fish as much as they desired.\r {BR}12  When they were filled, he said to his disciples, {I}{B}Gather up the broken pieces which are left over, that nothing be lost.{/B}{/I}\r {BR}13  So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which were left over by those who had eaten.\r {BR}14  When therefore the people saw the sign which Jesus did, they said, This is truly the prophet who comes into the world.\r {BR}15  Jesus therefore, perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew again to the mountain by himself.\r {BR}16  When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,\r {BR}17  and they entered into the boat, and were going over the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them.\r {BR}18  The sea was tossed by a great wind blowing.\r {BR}19  When therefore they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing near to the boat; and they were afraid.\r {BR}20  But he said to them, {I}{B}It is I. Don't be afraid.{/B}{/I}\r {BR}21  They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat. Immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.\r {BR}22  On the next day, the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except the one in which his disciples had embarked, and that Jesus hadn't entered with his disciples into the boat, but his disciples had gone away alone.\r {BR}23  However boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.\r {BR}24  When the multitude therefore saw that Jesus wasn't there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.\r {BR}25  When they found him on the other side of the sea, they asked him, Rabbi, when did you come here?\r {BR}26  Jesus answered them, {I}{B}Most certainly I tell you, you seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves, and were filled.{/B}{/I}\r {BR}27  {I}{B}Don't work for the food which perishes, but for the food which remains to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you.

How then does he say, {I}{B}'I have come down out of heaven?' {/B}{/I}\r {BR}43  Therefore Jesus answered them, {I}{B}Don't murmur among yourselves.{/B}{/I}\r {BR}44  {I}{B}No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up in the last day.{/B}{/I}\r {BR}45  {I}{B}It is written in the prophets, 'They will all be taught by God.'

The house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.\r {BR}4  Then Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, one of his disciples, who would betray him, said,\r {BR}5  Why wasn't this ointment sold for three hundred denarii, and given to the poor?\r {BR}6  Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the money box, used to steal what was put into it.\r {BR}7  But Jesus said, {I}{B}Leave her alone. She has kept this for the day of my burial.{/B}{/I}\r {BR}8  {I}{B}For you always have the poor with you, but you don't always have me.{/B}{/I}\r {BR}9  A large crowd therefore of the Jews learned that he was there, and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.\r {BR}10  But the chief priests conspired to put Lazarus to death also,\r {BR}11  because on account of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus.\r {BR}12  On the next day a great multitude had come to the feast. When they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,\r {BR}13  they took the branches of the palm trees, and went out to meet him, and cried out, Hosanna!

Behold, your King comes, sitting on a donkey's colt.\r {BR}16  His disciples didn't understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about him, and that they had done these things to him.\r {BR}17  The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, was testifying about it.\r {BR}18  For this cause also the multitude went and met him, because they heard that he had done this sign.\r {BR}19  The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, See how you accomplish nothing. Behold, the world has gone after him.\r {BR}20  Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast.\r {BR}21  These, therefore, came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we want to see Jesus.\r {BR}22  Philip came and told Andrew, and in turn, Andrew came with Philip, and they told Jesus.\r {BR}23  Jesus answered them, {I}{B}The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.{/B}{/I}\r {BR}24  {I}{B}Most certainly I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone.

Others said, An angel has spoken to him.\r {BR}30  Jesus answered, {I}{B}This voice hasn't come for my sake, but for your sakes.{/B}{/I}\r {BR}31  {I}{B}Now is the judgment of this world.

He hoped to see some miracle done by him.\r {BR}9  He questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers.\r {BR}10  The chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.\r {BR}11  Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent him back to Pilate.\r {BR}12  Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each other.\r {BR}13  Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,\r {BR}14  and said to them, You brought this man to me as one that perverts the people, and see, I have examined him before you, and found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you accuse him.\r {BR}15  Neither has Herod, for I sent you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.\r {BR}16  I will therefore chastise him and release him.\r {BR}17  Now he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast.\r {BR}18  But they all cried out together, saying, Away with this man!

I will therefore chastise him and release him.\r {BR}23  But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed.\r {BR}24  Pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done.\r {BR}25  He released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus up to their will.\r {BR}26  When they led him away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it after Jesus.\r {BR}27  A great multitude of the people followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him.\r {BR}28  But Jesus, turning to them, said, {I}{B}Daughters of Jerusalem, don't weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.{/B}{/I}\r {BR}29  {I}{B}For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, 'Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.'{/B}{/I}\r {BR}30  {I}{B}Then they will begin to tell the mountains, 'Fall on us!' and tell the hills, 'Cover us.'{/B}{/I}\r {BR}31  {I}{B}For if they do these things in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?{/B}{/I}\r {BR}32  There were also others, two criminals, led with him to be put to death.\r {BR}33  When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left.\r {BR}34  Jesus said, {I}{B}Father, forgive them, for they don't know what they are doing.{/B}{/I} Dividing his garments among them, they cast lots.\r {BR}35  The people stood watching. The rulers with them also scoffed at him, saying, He saved others.

On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.\r {BR}{BR}{I}{B}WEB\\John\\19{/I}{/B}{BR}{BR}1  So Pilate then took Jesus, and flogged him.\r {BR}2  The soldiers twisted thorns into a crown, and put it on his head, and dressed him in a purple garment.\r {BR}3  They kept saying, Hail, King of the Jews! and they kept slapping him.\r {BR}4  Then Pilate went out again, and said to them, Behold, I bring him out to you, that you may know that I find no basis for a charge against him.\r {BR}5  Jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. Pilate said to them, Behold, the man!\r {BR}6  When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they shouted, saying, Crucify! Crucify! Pilate said to them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him, for I find no basis for a charge against him.\r {BR}7  The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.\r {BR}8  When therefore Pilate heard this saying, he was more afraid.\r {BR}9  He entered into the Praetorium again, and said to Jesus, Where are you from? But Jesus gave him no answer.\r {BR}10  Pilate therefore said to him, Aren't you speaking to me? Don't you know that I have power to release you, and have power to crucify you?\r {BR}11  Jesus answered, {I}{B}You would have no power at all against me, unless it were given to you from above. Therefore he who delivered me to you has greater sin.{/B}{/I}\r {BR}12  At this, Pilate was seeking to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, If you release this man, you aren't Caesar's friend! Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar!\r {BR}13  When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.\r {BR}14  Now it was the Preparation Day of the Passover, at about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, Behold, your King!\r {BR}15  They cried out, Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him! Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar!\r {BR}16  So then he delivered him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and led him away.\r {BR}17  He went out, bearing his cross, to the place called The Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha,\r {BR}18  where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the middle.\r {BR}19  Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. There was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.\r {BR}20  Therefore many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.\r {BR}21  The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Don't write, 'The King of the Jews,' but, 'he said, I am King of the Jews.' \r {BR}22  Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written.\r {BR}23  Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.\r {BR}24  Then they said to one another, Let's not tear it, but cast lots for it to decide whose it will be, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which says, They parted my garments among them. For my cloak they cast lots. Therefore the soldiers did these things.\r {BR}25  But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.\r {BR}26  Therefore when Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother, {I}{B}Woman, behold your son!{/B}{/I}\r {BR}27  Then he said to the disciple, {I}{B}Behold, your mother!{/B}{/I} From that hour, the disciple took her to his own home.\r {BR}28  After this, Jesus, seeing that all things were now finished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, {I}{B}I am thirsty.{/B}{/I}\r {BR}29  Now a vessel full of vinegar was set there; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop, and held it at his mouth.\r {BR}30  When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, {I}{B}It is finished.{/B}{/I} He bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.\r {BR}31  Therefore the Jews, because it was the Preparation Day, so that the bodies wouldn't remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a special one), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.\r {BR}32  Therefore the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with him;\r {BR}33  but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was already dead, they didn't break his legs.\r {BR}34  However one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.\r {BR}35  He who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, that you may believe.\r {BR}36  For these things happened, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of him will not be broken.\r {BR}37  Again another Scripture says, They will look on him whom they pierced.\r {BR}38  After these things, Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away Jesus' body. Pilate gave him permission.

Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved by God to you by mighty works and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you, even as you yourselves know,\r {BR}23  him, being delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken by the hand of lawless men, crucified and killed;\r {BR}24  whom God raised up, having freed him from the agony of death, because it was not possible that he should be held by it.\r {BR}25  For David says concerning him, 'I saw the Lord always before my face, For he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved.\r {BR}26  Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced. Moreover my flesh also will dwell in hope;\r {BR}27  because you will not leave my soul in Hades, neither will you allow your Holy One to see decay.\r {BR}28  You made known to me the ways of life. You will make me full of gladness with your presence.'\r {BR}29  Brothers, I may tell you freely of the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.\r {BR}30  Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body, according to the flesh, he would raise up the Christ to sit on his throne,\r {BR}31  he foreseeing this spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was his soul left in Hades, nor did his flesh see decay.\r {BR}32  This Jesus God raised up, to which we all are witnesses.\r {BR}33  Being therefore exalted by the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this, which you now see and hear.\r {BR}34  For David didn't ascend into the heavens, but he says himself, 'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit by my right hand,\r {BR}35  until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet. '\r {BR}36  Let all the house of Israel therefore know certainly that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.\r {BR}37  Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, Brothers, what shall we do?\r {BR}38  Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.\r {BR}39  For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all who are far off, even as many as the Lord our God will call to himself.\r {BR}40  With many other words he testified, and exhorted them, saying, Save yourselves from this crooked generation!\r {BR}41  Then those who gladly received his word were baptized. There were added that day about three thousand souls.\r {BR}42  They continued steadfastly in the apostles' teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and prayer.\r {BR}43  Fear came on every soul, and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.\r {BR}44  All who believed were together, and had all things in common.\r {BR}45  They sold their possessions and goods, and distributed them to all, according as anyone had need.\r {BR}46  Day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread at home, they took their food with gladness and singleness of heart,\r {BR}47  praising God, and having favor with all the people. The Lord added to the assembly day by day those who were being saved.\r {BR}{BR}"},{scriptures:"Acts\\4",id:"91",title:"The Apostles Courage",verses:"{I}{B}WEB\\Acts\\4{/I}{/B}{BR}{BR}1  As they spoke to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came to them,\r {BR}2  being upset because they taught the people and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.\r {BR}3  They laid hands on them, and put them in custody until the next day, for it was now evening.\r {BR}4  But many of those who heard the word believed, and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.\r {BR}5  It happened in the morning, that their rulers, elders, and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem.\r {BR}6  Annas the high priest was there, with Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and as many as were relatives of the high priest.\r {BR}7  When they had stood them in the middle of them, they inquired, By what power, or in what name, have you done this?\r {BR}8  Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, You rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,\r {BR}9  if we are examined today concerning a good deed done to a crippled man, by what means this man has been healed,\r {BR}10  be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, in him does this man stand here before you whole.\r {BR}11  He is 'the stone which was regarded as worthless by you, the builders, which has become the head of the corner.'\r {BR}12  There is salvation in none other, for neither is there any other name under heaven, that is given among men, by which we must be saved!\r {BR}13  Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled. They recognized that they had been with Jesus.\r {BR}14  Seeing the man who was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.\r {BR}15  But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,\r {BR}16  saying, What shall we do to these men? Because indeed a notable miracle has been done through them, as can be plainly seen by all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we can't deny it.\r {BR}17  But so that this spreads no further among the people, let's threaten them, that from now on they don't speak to anyone in this name.\r {BR}18  They called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.\r {BR}19  But Peter and John answered them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, judge for yourselves,\r {BR}20  for we can't help telling the things which we saw and heard.\r {BR}21  When they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people; for everyone glorified God for that which was done.\r {BR}22  For the man on whom this miracle of healing was performed was more than forty years old.\r {BR}23  Being let go, they came to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.\r {BR}24  When they heard it, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, O Lord, you are God, who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and all that is in them;\r {BR}25  who by the mouth of your servant, David, said, 'Why do the nations rage, and the peoples plot a vain thing?\r {BR}26  The kings of the earth take a stand, and the rulers take council together, against the Lord, and against his Christ.'\r {BR}27  For truly, in this city against your holy servant, Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered together\r {BR}28  to do whatever your hand and your council foreordained to happen.\r {BR}29  Now, Lord, look at their threats, and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness,\r {BR}30  while you stretch out your hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of your holy Servant Jesus.\r {BR}31  When they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were gathered together. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.\r {BR}32  The multitude of those who believed were of one heart and soul. Not one of them claimed that anything of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had all things in common.\r {BR}33  With great power, the apostles gave their testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. Great grace was on them all.\r {BR}34  For neither was there among them any who lacked, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of the things that were sold,\r {BR}35  and laid them at the apostles' feet, and distribution was made to each, according as anyone had need.\r {BR}36  Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, Son of Encouragement), a Levite, a man of Cyprus by race,\r {BR}37  having a field, sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet.\r {BR}{BR}"},{scriptures:"Acts\\5",id:"92",title:"Ananias and Sapphira",verses:"{I}{B}WEB\\Acts\\5{/I}{/B}{BR}{BR}1  But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira, his wife, sold a possession,\r {BR}2  and kept back part of the price, his wife also being aware of it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet.\r {BR}3  But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back part of the price of the land?\r {BR}4  While you kept it, didn't it remain your own?

But the high priest came, and those who were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.\r {BR}22  But the officers who came didn't find them in the prison. They returned and reported,\r {BR}23  We found the prison shut and locked, and the guards standing before the doors, but when we opened them, we found no one inside!\r {BR}24  Now when the high priest, the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these words, they were very perplexed about them and what might become of this.\r {BR}25  One came and told them, Behold, the men whom you put in prison are in the temple, standing and teaching the people.\r {BR}26  Then the captain went with the officers, and brought them without violence, for they were afraid that the people might stone them.\r {BR}27  When they had brought them, they set them before the council.

Behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and intend to bring this man's blood on us.\r {BR}29  But Peter and the apostles answered, We must obey God rather than men.\r {BR}30  The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you killed, hanging him on a tree.\r {BR}31  God exalted him with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins.\r {BR}32  We are His witnesses of these things; and so also is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.\r {BR}33  But they, when they heard this, were cut to the heart, and determined to kill them.\r {BR}34  But one stood up in the council, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, honored by all the people, and commanded to put the apostles out for a little while.\r {BR}35  He said to them, You men of Israel, be careful concerning these men, what you are about to do.\r {BR}36  For before these days Theudas rose up, making himself out to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were dispersed, and came to nothing.\r {BR}37  After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the enrollment, and drew away some people after him.

Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God to hear all things that have been commanded you by God.\r {BR}34  Peter opened his mouth and said, Truly I perceive that God doesn't show favoritism;\r {BR}35  but in every nation he who fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him.\r {BR}36  The word which he sent to the children of Israel, preaching good news of peace by Jesus Christ-he is Lord of all-\r {BR}37  that spoken word you yourselves know, which was proclaimed throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;\r {BR}38  even Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.\r {BR}39  We are witnesses of everything he did both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they also killed, hanging him on a tree.\r {BR}40  God raised him up the third day, and gave him to be revealed,\r {BR}41  not to all the people, but to witnesses who were chosen before by God, to us, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.\r {BR}42  He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that this is he who is appointed by God as the Judge of the living and the dead.\r {BR}43  All the prophets testify about him, that through his name everyone who believes in him will receive remission of sins.\r {BR}44  While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the word.\r {BR}45  They of the circumcision who believed were amazed, as many as came with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was also poured out on the Gentiles.\r {BR}46  For they heard them speaking in other languages and magnifying God. Then Peter answered,\r {BR}47  Can any man forbid the water, that these who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we should not be baptized?\r {BR}48  He commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.

He came to them,\r {BR}3  and because he practiced the same trade, he lived with them and worked, for by trade they were tent makers.\r {BR}4  He reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks.\r {BR}5  But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was compelled by the Spirit, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.\r {BR}6  When they opposed him and blasphemed, he shook out his clothing and said to them, Your blood be on your own heads! I am clean. From now on, I will go to the Gentiles!\r {BR}7  He departed there, and went into the house of a certain man named Justus, one who worshiped God, whose house was next door to the synagogue.\r {BR}8  Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his house. Many of the Corinthians, when they heard, believed and were baptized.\r {BR}9  The Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision, {I}{B}Don't be afraid, but speak and don't be silent;{/B}{/I}\r {BR}10  {I}{B}for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many people in this city.{/B}{/I}\r {BR}11  He lived there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.\r {BR}12  But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat,\r {BR}13  saying, This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.\r {BR}14  But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of wicked crime, you Jews, it would be reasonable that I should bear with you;\r {BR}15  but if they are questions about words and names and your own law, look to it yourselves. For I don't want to be a judge of these matters.\r {BR}16  He drove them from the judgment seat.\r {BR}17  Then all the Greeks laid hold on Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. Gallio didn't care about any of these things.\r {BR}18  Paul, having stayed after this many more days, took his leave of the brothers, and sailed from there for Syria, together with Priscilla and Aquila. He shaved his head in Cenchreae, for he had a vow.\r {BR}19  He came to Ephesus, and he left them there; but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.\r {BR}20  When they asked him to stay with them a longer time, he declined;\r {BR}21  but taking his leave of them, and saying, I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem, but I will return again to you if God wills, he set sail from Ephesus.\r {BR}22  When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the assembly, and went down to Antioch.\r {BR}23  Having spent some time there, he departed, and went through the region of Galatia, and Phrygia, in order, establishing all the disciples.\r {BR}24  Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus. He was mighty in the Scriptures.\r {BR}25  This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, although he knew only the baptism of John.\r {BR}26  He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside, and explained to him the way of God more accurately.\r {BR}27  When he had determined to pass over into Achaia, the brothers encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him. When he had come, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace;\r {BR}28  for he powerfully refuted the Jews, publicly showing by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.\r {BR}{BR}"},{scriptures:"Acts\\19",id:"97",title:"Paul in Ephesus",verses:"{I}{B}WEB\\Acts\\19{/I}{/B}{BR}{BR}1  It happened that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper country, came to Ephesus, and found certain disciples.\r {BR}2  He said to them, Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed? They said to him, No, we haven't even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.\r {BR}3  He said, Into what then were you baptized? They said, Into John's baptism.\r {BR}4  Paul said, John indeed baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe in the one who would come after him, that is, in Jesus.\r {BR}5  When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.\r {BR}6  When Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke with other languages and prophesied.\r {BR}7  They were about twelve men in all.\r {BR}8  He entered into the synagogue, and spoke boldly for a period of three months, reasoning and persuading about the things concerning the Kingdom of God.\r {BR}9  But when some were hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.\r {BR}10  This continued for two years, so that all those who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.\r {BR}11  God worked special miracles by the hands of Paul,\r {BR}12  so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were carried away from his body to the sick, and the evil spirits went out.\r {BR}13  But some of the itinerant Jews, exorcists, took on themselves to invoke over those who had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.\r {BR}14  There were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did this.\r {BR}15  The evil spirit answered, Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are you?\r {BR}16  The man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overpowered them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.\r {BR}17  This became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who lived at Ephesus. Fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.\r {BR}18  Many also of those who had believed came, confessing, and declaring their deeds.\r {BR}19  Many of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all. They counted the price of them, and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.\r {BR}20  So the word of the Lord was growing and becoming mighty.\r {BR}21  Now after these things had ended, Paul determined in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.\r {BR}22  Having sent into Macedonia two of those who served him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.\r {BR}23  About that time there arose no small stir concerning the Way.\r {BR}24  For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business to the craftsmen,\r {BR}25  whom he gathered together, with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, you know that by this business we have our wealth.\r {BR}26  You see and hear, that not at Ephesus alone, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that they are no gods, that are made with hands.\r {BR}27  Not only is there danger that this our trade come into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be counted as nothing, and her majesty destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worships.\r {BR}28  When they heard this they were filled with anger, and cried out, saying, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!\r {BR}29  The whole city was filled with confusion, and they rushed with one accord into the theater, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel.\r {BR}30  When Paul wanted to enter in to the people, the disciples didn't allow him.\r {BR}31  Certain also of the Asiarchs, being his friends, sent to him and begged him not to venture into the theater.\r {BR}32  Some therefore cried one thing, and some another, for the assembly was in confusion. Most of them didn't know why they had come together.\r {BR}33  They brought Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. Alexander beckoned with his hand, and would have made a defense to the people.\r {BR}34  But when they perceived that he was a Jew, all with one voice for a time of about two hours cried out, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!\r {BR}35  When the town clerk had quieted the multitude, he said, You men of Ephesus, what man is there who doesn't know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great goddess Artemis, and of the image which fell down from Zeus?\r {BR}36  Seeing then that these things can't be denied, you ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rash.\r {BR}37  For you have brought these men here, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of your goddess.\r {BR}38  If therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a matter against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls. Let them press charges against one another.\r {BR}39  But if you seek anything about other matters, it will be settled in the regular assembly.\r {BR}40  For indeed we are in danger of being accused concerning this day's riot, there being no cause.

Julius treated Paul kindly, and gave him permission to go to his friends and refresh himself.\r {BR}4  Putting to sea from there, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.\r {BR}5  When we had sailed across the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.\r {BR}6  There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy, and he put us on board.\r {BR}7  When we had sailed slowly many days, and had come with difficulty opposite Cnidus, the wind not allowing us further, we sailed under the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone.\r {BR}8  With difficulty sailing along it we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea.\r {BR}9  When much time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous, because the Fast had now already gone by, Paul admonished them,\r {BR}10  and said to them, Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.\r {BR}11  But the centurion gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship than to those things which were spoken by Paul.\r {BR}12  Because the haven was not suitable to winter in, the majority advised going to sea from there, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, and winter there, which is a port of Crete, looking northeast and southeast.\r {BR}13  When the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close to shore.\r {BR}14  But before long, a stormy wind beat down from shore, which is called Euroclydon.\r {BR}15  When the ship was caught, and couldn't face the wind, we gave way to it, and were driven along.\r {BR}16  Running under the lee of a small island called Clauda, we were able, with difficulty, to secure the boat.\r {BR}17  After they had hoisted it up, they used cables to help reinforce the ship. Fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis sand bars, they lowered the sea anchor, and so were driven along.\r {BR}18  As we labored exceedingly with the storm, the next day they began to throw things overboard.\r {BR}19  On the third day, they threw out the ship's tackle with their own hands.\r {BR}20  When neither sun nor stars shone on us for many days, and no small storm pressed on us, all hope that we would be saved was now taken away.\r {BR}21  When they had been long without food, Paul stood up in the middle of them, and said, Sirs, you should have listened to me, and not have set sail from Crete, and have gotten this injury and loss.\r {BR}22  Now I exhort you to cheer up, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.\r {BR}23  For there stood by me this night an angel, belonging to the God whose I am and whom I serve,\r {BR}24  saying, 'Don't be afraid, Paul. You must stand before Caesar. Behold, God has granted you all those who sail with you.'\r {BR}25  Therefore, sirs, cheer up! For I believe God, that it will be just as it has been spoken to me.\r {BR}26  But we must run aground on a certain island.\r {BR}27  But when the fourteenth night had come, as we were driven back and forth in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some land.\r {BR}28  They took soundings, and found twenty fathoms. After a little while, they took soundings again, and found fifteen fathoms.\r {BR}29  Fearing that we would run aground on rocky ground, they let go four anchors from the stern, and wished for daylight.\r {BR}30  As the sailors were trying to flee out of the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, pretending that they would lay out anchors from the bow,\r {BR}31  Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Unless these stay in the ship, you can't be saved.\r {BR}32  Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let it fall off.\r {BR}33  While the day was coming on, Paul begged them all to take some food, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that you wait and continue fasting, having taken nothing.\r {BR}34  Therefore I beg you to take some food, for this is for your safety; for not a hair will perish from any of your heads.\r {BR}35  When he had said this, and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all, and he broke it, and began to eat.\r {BR}36  Then they all cheered up, and they also took food.\r {BR}37  In all, we were two hundred seventy-six souls on the ship.\r {BR}38  When they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.\r {BR}39  When it was day, they didn't recognize the land, but they noticed a certain bay with a beach, and they decided to try to drive the ship onto it.\r {BR}40  Casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time untying the rudder ropes. Hoisting up the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.\r {BR}41  But coming to a place where two seas met, they ran the vessel aground. The bow struck and remained immovable, but the stern began to break up by the violence of the waves.\r {BR}42  The soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, so that none of them would swim out and escape.\r {BR}43  But the centurion, desiring to save Paul, stopped them from their purpose, and commanded that those who could swim should throw themselves overboard first to go toward the land;\r {BR}44  and the rest should follow, some on planks, and some on other things from the ship. So it happened that they all escaped safely to the land.\r {BR}{BR}{I}{B}WEB\\Acts\\28{/I}{/B}{BR}{BR}1  When we had escaped, then they learned that the island was called Malta.\r {BR}2  The natives showed us uncommon kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.\r {BR}3  But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat, and fastened on his hand.\r {BR}4  When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said one to another, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped from the sea, yet Justice has not allowed to live.\r {BR}5  However he shook off the creature into the fire, and wasn't harmed.\r {BR}6  But they expected that he would have swollen or fallen down dead suddenly, but when they watched for a long time and saw nothing bad happen to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.\r {BR}7  Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us, and courteously entertained us for three days.\r {BR}8  It happened that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery. Paul entered in to him, prayed, and laying his hands on him, healed him.\r {BR}9  Then when this was done, the rest also who had diseases in the island came, and were cured.\r {BR}10  They also honored us with many honors, and when we sailed, they put on board the things that we needed.\r {BR}11  After three months, we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was The Twin Brothers.\r {BR}12  Touching at Syracuse, we stayed there three days.\r {BR}13  From there we circled around and arrived at Rhegium. After one day, a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli,\r {BR}14  where we found brothers, and were entreated to stay with them for seven days. So we came to Rome.\r {BR}15  From there the brothers, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns. When Paul saw them, he thanked God, and took courage.\r {BR}16  When we entered into Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard, but Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who guarded him.\r {BR}17  It happened that after three days Paul called together those who were the leaders of the Jews. When they had come together, he said to them, I, brothers, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, still was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,\r {BR}18  who, when they had examined me, desired to set me free, because there was no cause of death in me.\r {BR}19  But when the Jews spoke against it, I was constrained to appeal to Caesar, not that I had anything about which to accuse my nation.\r {BR}20  For this cause therefore I asked to see you and to speak with you. For because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.\r {BR}21  They said to him, We neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor did any of the brothers come here and report or speak any evil of you.\r {BR}22  But we desire to hear from you what you think. For, as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.\r {BR}23  When they had appointed him a day, many people came to him at his lodging. He explained to them, testifying about the Kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning until evening.\r {BR}24  Some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.\r {BR}25  When they didn't agree among themselves, they departed after Paul had spoken one word, The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah, the prophet, to our fathers,\r {BR}26  saying, 'Go to this people, and say, in hearing, you will hear, but will in no way understand. In seeing, you will see, but will in no way perceive.\r {BR}27  For this people's heart has grown callous. Their ears are dull of hearing. Their eyes they have closed. Lest they should see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their heart, and would turn again, and I would heal them.'\r {BR}28  Be it known therefore to you, that the salvation of God is sent to the nations. They will also listen.\r {BR}29  When he had said these words, the Jews departed, having a great dispute among themselves.\r {BR}30  Paul stayed two whole years in his own rented house, and received all who were coming to him,\r {BR}31  preaching the Kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, without hindrance.\r {BR}{BR}"}],tablename:"GreatStories"};
