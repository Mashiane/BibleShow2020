So he went away, washed, and came back seeing.\r {BR}8  The neighbors therefore, and those who saw that he was blind before, said, Isn't this he who sat and begged?\r {BR}9  Others were saying, It is he. Still others were saying, He looks like him.

He said, I don't know.\r {BR}13  They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees.\r {BR}14  It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.\r {BR}15  Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight.

Others said, How can a man who is a sinner do such signs? There was division among them.\r {BR}17  Therefore they asked the blind man again, What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes? He said, He is a prophet.\r {BR}18  The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight,\r {BR}19  and asked them, Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?\r {BR}20  His parents answered them, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;\r {BR}21  but how he now sees, we don't know; or who opened his eyes, we don't know. He is of age. Ask him. He will speak for himself.\r {BR}22  His parents said these things because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.\r {BR}23  Therefore his parents said, He is of age. Ask him.\r {BR}24  So they called the man who was blind a second time, and said to him, Give glory to God.
